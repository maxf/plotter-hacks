CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility Base here.


CDR (TRANQ)
THE EAGLE HAS LANDED.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.


 CDR (TRANQ)
Thank you.


CC
You're looking good here.


 CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. We're going to be busy for a minute.


 LMP (TRANQ)
MASTER ARM, ON. Take care of the ... I'll get this ...


 LMP (TRANQ)
Very smooth touchdown.


 LMP (TRANQ)
...


 LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. It looks like we're venting the oxidizer now.


CC
Roger, Eagle. And you are STAY for - -


 LMP (TRANQ)
...


CC
- - T1. Over. Eagle, you are STAY for T1.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Understand, STAY for T1.


CC
Roger. And we see you venting the 0X.


 LMP (TRANQ)
Roger.







LMP (TRANQ)
... circuit breaker.


LMP (TRANQ)
... copy NOUN 60, NOUN 43. Over.


CC
Roger. We have it.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, how do you read Columbia on the high gain?


CC
Roger - -


LMP (TRANQ)
...


CC
- - We read you five by, Columbia. He has landed, Tranquility Base. Eagle is at Tranquility. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Yes. I heard the whole thing.


CC
... good show.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Fantastic.


LMP (TRANQ)
Engine STOP RESET.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia went UPTELEMETRY COMMAND, RESET, to reacquire on the high gain.


CC
Copy. Out.


CC
Eagle, Houston. You loaded R2 wrong. We want 10254.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger.


LMP (TRANQ)
And do you want V horizontal 5515.2?


CC
That's affirmative.


LMP (TRANQ)
Like - AGS to PGNS align.


CC
Say again?







LMP (TRANQ)
Like an AGS to PNGS align. Over.


CC
Roger. We're standing by for it.


LMP (TRANQ)
... quantity ...


CC
Eagle, Houston. You are STAY for T2. Over.


CC
Correction, you're - -


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. STAY for T2. We thank you.


CC
Roger, sir.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We recommend you exit P12. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Hey, Houston, that may have seemed like a very long final phase. The AUTO targeting was taking us right into a football field size - football field sized crater, with a large number of big boulders and rocks for about ... one or two crater diameters around it, and it required a ... in P66 and flying manually over the rock field to find a reasonably good area.


CC
Roger. We copy. It was beautiful from here, Tranquility. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
We'll get to the details of what's around here, but it looks like a collection of just about every variety of shape, angularity, granularity, about every variety of rock you could find. The colors - Well, it varies pretty much depending on how you're looking relative to the zerophase point. There doesn't appear to be too much of a general color at all. However, it looks as though some of the rocks and boulders, of which there are quite a few in the near area, it looks as though they're going to have some interesting colors to them. Over.


CC
Roger. Copy. Sounds good to us, Tranquility. We'll let you press on through the simulated countdown, and we'll talk to you later. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger.







LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. This one sixth g is just like the airplane.


CC
Roger. Tranquility. Be advised there's lots of smiling faces in this room and all over the world. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Well, there are two of them up here.


CC
Roger. That was a beautiful job, you guys.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
And don't forget one in the command module.


CC
Roger.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. We have you pitched up about 4 1/2 degrees. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
That's confirmed by our local observation.


CC
Roger.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
And thanks for putting me on relay, Houston. I was missing all the action.


CC
Roger. We'll enable MSFN relay.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
I just got it, I think.


CC
Roger, Columbia. This is Houston. Say something. They ought to be able to hear you. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger, Tranquility Base. It sure sounded great from up here. You guys did a fantastic job.


CDR (TRANQ)
Thank you. Just keep that orbiting base ready for us up there now.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Will do.


CC
Columbia, Houston. LOS 103 27, AOS 104 13. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Thank you.







CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. All your consumables are solid. You're looking good in every respect. We copy the DPS are venting. Everything is copasetic. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Thank you, Houston.


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, the guys that said that we wouldn't be able to tell precisely where we are are the winners today. We were a little busy worrying about program alarms and things like that in the part of the descent where we would normally be picking out our landing spot; and aside from a good look at several of the craters we came over in the final descent, I haven't been able to pick out the things on the horizon as a reference as yet.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. No sweat. We'll figure out - We'll figure it out. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
You might be interested to know that I don't think we notice any difficulty at all in adapting to one sixth g. It seems immediately natural to move in this environment.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. We copy. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
The area out the left hand window is a relatively level plain cratered with a fairly large number of craters of the 5  to 50 foot variety, and some ridges - small, 20, 30 feet high, I would guess, and literally thousands of little 1  and 2 foot craters around the area. We see some angular blocks out several hundred feet in front of us that are probably 2 feet in size and have angular edges. There is a hill in view, just about on the ground track ahead of us. Difficult to estimate, but might be a half a mile or a mile.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. We copy Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Sounds like it looks a lot better than it did yesterday - -


CDR (TRANQ)
...







CMP (COLUMBIA)
- - at that very low Sun angle. It looked rough as a cob then.


CDR (TRANQ)
It really was rough, Mike. Over the targeted landing area, it was extremely rough, cratered, and large numbers of rocks that were probably some, many larger than 5 or 10 feet in size.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
When in doubt, land long.


CDR (TRANQ)
So we did.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. After you get through this P57, we'd like an E memory dump. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. After this first P57, you want an E memory dump.


CC
That's affirmative.


CC
Columbia, Houston. We have a P22 update for you, if you're ready to copy. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
At your service, sir.


CC
Roger, Mike. T1, 104 32 18; T2, 104 37 28. And that is 4 miles south. This is based on a targeted landing site. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Roger. Understand based on a targeted landing site; T1, 104 32 18; T2, 104 37 28, and 4 miles south.


CC
Roger.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Do you have any idea whether they landed left or right of center line? Just a little bit long, is that all we know?


CC
Apparently that's about all we can tell. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Thank you.


CC
Tranquility, Houston - -


CDR (TRANQ)
And, Houston, our mission timer is now reading 902 34 47 and static.







CC
Roger. Copy your mission timer's now static. It - Say again the time?


CDR (TRANQ)
902 34 47.


CC
Roger. Copy, Tranquility. That gravity align looked good to us. We see you recycling.


LMP (TRANQ)
Well, no. I was trying to get time, 16 65 out, and somehow it proceeded on to the 622 before I could do a VERB 32 ENTER. I want to log a time here, and then I'd like to know whether you want me to proceed on the torquing angles or to go back and reenter again before torquing. Over.


CC
Roger, Buzz. Stand by.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. We'd like you to recall P57 and run through the gravity align one more time. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. I concur with that.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. For the mission timer, two suggestions. Set the circuit breaker, panel 11; also reset and attempt to start. That nine in the first digit might have something to do with it. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. We've tried both of those. If the circuit breaker is in when I reset the - put it in RESET, I get 902 04 40. When I release it now, I get 902 04 49. I'm going to cycle the circuit breaker.


CC
Roger.


CDR (TRANQ)
I cycled the circuit breaker and got all nines. And we'll not now reset from all nines.


CC
Roger.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. We'll research this problem and be back with you momentarily on the mission event time - correction, the mission timer.







CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


CDR (TRANQ)
I'd say the color of the - The local surface is very comparable to that we observed from orbit at this Sun angle, about 10 degrees Sun angle, or that nature. It's pretty much without color. It's gray, and it's a very white, chalky gray, as you look into the zero phase line; and it's considerably darker gray, more like a ash - ashen gray as you look out 90 degrees to the Sun. The - Some of the surface rocks in close here that have been fractured or disturbed by the rocket engine plume are coated with this light gray on the outside; but where they've been broken, they display a dark - very dark gray interior; and it looks like it could be country basalt.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. We see the NOUN 93, VERB 34.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. I assume you wanted it. Roger.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Please vent fuel and OX again. Over. It's building back up.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. OX going now.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. You can open both fuel and OX vent now. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility standing by for GO on a AGS to PGNS align and a lunar align. Over.


CC
Stand by.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. You are GO for the AGS to PGNS align and a lunar align. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Please vent the fuel. It's increasing rapidly. Over.







CDR (TRANQ)
We show 30 psi in the fuel and 30 in the oxidizer.


CC
Roger. We're reading somewhat different than that. Stand by.


CDR (TRANQ)
The fuel temperature is reading 64 in the descent, and the oxidizer - that's descent 2 - and the oxidizer is off scale low. Descent 1 is showing 61 in the fuel and 65 in the oxidizer.


CC
Roger. Stand by. Tranquility, Houston. Please take the fuel vent switch and hold it open. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. We're holding it open. Indicating about 24 psi on board.


CC
Roger.


CDR (TRANQ)
Now indicating 20 psi in the fuel side.


CC
Roger.


CDR (TRANQ)
And 22 in the OX.


CC
Roger.


LMP (TRANQ)
Now indicating 15 psi in both tanks.


CC
Roger.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. If you haven't done so, you can release the fuel vent switch now. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. We have indication that we've frozen up the descent fuel helium heat exchanger, and there's some fuel trapped in the line between there and the valvs; and the pressure we're looking at is increasing there. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Understand.







CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. If you have not done so, please close both fuel and OX vents now. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
They're closed.


CC
Thank you, sir.


CDR (TRANQ)
From the surface, we could not see any stars out the window; but out my overhead hatch, I'm looking at the Earth. It's big and bright and beautiful. Buzz is going to give a try at seeing some stars through the optics.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. We understand. Must be a beautiful sight. Over.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Two minutes to LOS. You're looking great going over the hill. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Thank you. Glad to hear the system's looking good. You have a suggested attitude for me? This one here seems all right.


CC
Stand by.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Let me know when it's lunch time, will you?


CC
Say again.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Oh, disregard.


CC
Columbia, Houston. You got a good attitude right there.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Thank you.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. If you want me to, I can give you a hack on the mission time, every 30 minutes. Over.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. I'm counting down to T3 time. If you'd like to give me a hack, we can set up an event timer. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. How about counting up?


CC
Roger. You want it counting up? Stand by.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. On my Mark, 62 30.


CC
MARK.


CC
62 30 from - past PDI.


LMP (TRANQ)
What we're looking for, Charlie, is the time counting up to T2 that'll be equal to 60 minutes - or T3, be equal to 60 minutes on T3.


CC
Roger. We'll have it for you.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. Reset the event timer to zero and on my Mark at 103 39 41. We'll give you a hack, and it'll be 1 hour. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger.


CC
And we've got about - almost 3 minutes to go, Neil. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


CC
Tranquility Base, stand by on the event timer.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. On my Mark start your event timer.


CC
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.


CC
MARK.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. We got it; thank you.







CC
Roger, Neil.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. We see the star angle difference. Looks good.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. That last star was Navi, and it wasn't too well distinguishable. I can see where that error could come in. I think for the gravity alignment with one star, Rigel will be quite good.


CC
Roger. Stand by on the NOUN 93.


CC
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. We'd like you to torque that. Over.


BEGIN LUNAR REV 15


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, this is Tranquility. Do you want us to accept this position? Over.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. We're looking at it. Stand by. We'd like you to pull the circuit breaker on panel 11 for the mission timer. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I've already done that, Charlie.


CC
Okay.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. We'd like you to reject that RLS. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger.


CC
And, Tranquility Base, Houston. We'd like you to call - after this, call P00, and give us a E memory dump.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Here comes the E memory dump.


CC
Roger.


LMP (TRANQ)
And we got 1106.


CC
Roger.







CC
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. Did I copy PROGRAM ALARM 1106 from you? Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. That' s affirmative.


CC
Okay. Stand by.


LMP (TRANQ)
Could that, by any chance, be due to the fact that I flashed the updata link switch to DATA while that was going on? Over.


CC
Stand by.


CC
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. The SPAN guys think that's conceivable. Stand by. I think we want another VERB 74.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Standing by.


CC
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. We'd like another VERB 74. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)

LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Say again R1 and NOUN 86.


CC
Roger. R1 is plus 0538, and we have a load for you. Will you please give us P00 and DATA? Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Before I do that I would like to designate the rendezvous radar up to plus-X.


CC

CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Thank you.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility Base. Does somebody down there have a mike button keyed? Over.


CC
Stand by, and we'll check.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Do you still hear it now? Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
I still hear it. it sounds like somebody banging chairs around in the back room.


CC
Roger. That's a VOGAA that you hear for the CSM to keep the noise down on the loop. Maybe we got a MSFN relay or something. Stand by.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. We got the MSFN relay in. You're hearing the VOGAA, which is a noise suppression device. We'll try to take it out. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
All right. Thank you.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. It ought to be a little quieter up there now. We disabled the MSFN relay.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. I think the noise has stopped now. Thank you, Charlie.


CC

CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. I'm on panel 9. Ready to receive. You want me to transmit for some reason with it?


CC
Say again, Mike. You're about two by.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Panel 9 is configured VHF, RECEIVE. You want me to transmit with the HF for some reason? Why do you want me in TR?


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. We don't want you to transmit, Mike. We just want you in that position in case you want to talk to Tranquility. Break. Tranquility, Houston. Say again. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I have a fairly good sized difference between battery volts on 5 and 6; 6 is reading 33.5 and 5 is reading 36.5. Is that what you expect? Over.

CC
And, Tranquility Base, the White Team is going off now and letting the Maroon Team take over. We appreciate the great show. It was a beautiful Job, you guys.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Couldn't of had better agreement from all of you back there.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility.


CC
Go, Tranquility. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Our recommendation at this point is planning an EVA with your concurrence starting about eight o'clock this evening, Houston time. That is about 3 hours from now.


CC
Stand by.


LMP (TRANQ)
Well, we will give you some time to think about that.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We thought about it; we will support it. You're GO at that time. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger.


CC
You guys are getting prime time TV there.


CDR (TRANQ)
Hope that little TV set works, but we'll see.


CC
Roger.


CC
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. Was your eight o'clock Houston time a reference to opening the hatch or starting the PREP for EVA at that time? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
That would be hatch opening.







CC
That's what we thought. Thank you much.


CDR (TRANQ)
That might be a little later than that, but in other words, start the PREP in about an hour or so.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. Copy NOUN 49?

Break. Columbia, we see the NOUN 49. Stand by.


CC
Columbia, Houston. We got the data. We would like a VERB 34. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
All right. Stand by one, Charlie, for the next one.


CC
Roger, Columbia. Did - How did Tranquility look to you down there? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Well, the area looks smooth, but I was unable to see him. I just picked out a distinguishable crater nearby and marked on it.


CC
Roger.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
It looks like a nice area, though.


CC
Hello, Columbia. Houston. I understand you could not see Tranquility. What were you marking on? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. I say again, I could not see him. AUTO optics pointed at a spot very close to the coordinates which you gave me, so I picked a tiny crater in that area and marked on it so I will be able to have repeatable data, but I was unable to see him.


CC
Roger. Copy.







CC
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. On our DPS venting and that fuel problem, our heat exchanger is cleared up. We heard that the ice is melted, and we are in good shape now. Out.

Columbia, Houston. We noticed you are maneuvering very close to gimbal lock. I suggest you move back away. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes. I am going around it, doing this CMC AUTO maneuvers to the PAD values of roll 270, pitch 101, yaw 45.


CC
Roger, Columbia.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
How about sending me a fourth gimbal for Christmas.


CC
Columbia, Houston. You were unreadable. Say again please.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Disregard.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Several items for you. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Ready to copy.


CC
Columbia, Houston. First of all, we'd like a waste water dump to 10 percent on the backside. Secondly, it does not look like we are going to need any plane change at this time, so we will not be uplinking a new REFSMMAT. Third item, I would like all of your CRYO heaters to AUTO, and we are ready for a battery charge, battery BRAVO; it will last about 7 hours. If you should go to sleep, we will be terminating that BATT charge, but at the moment, we can go ahead and start the BATT charge on BATT Bravo. And a final item, for your SM RCS configuration for your rest period, register 1 for the DAP is 11111; DAP register 2, 01100. And your AUTO RCS select







switches, quad Alfa, pitch jets on only, quad Bravo all on, quad Charlie and quad Delta all off. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Dump waste water to 10 percent on the backside. Use prior REFSMMAT, CRYO heaters on to AUTO, battery B charge until I go to sleep. DAP is 11111, 01100. Select quads A pitch only on, C and D all up. Over.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Roger.


CC
Columbia, Houston. We will have a state vector update for you a little later. We are not prepared with it right now; and on another subject, from Tranquility Base, they are prepared to begin their EVA early. They expect to begin DEPRESS operations in about 3 hours at 108, approximately 108 GET. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Sounds good to me. Tell them to eat some lunch before they go.


CC
Columbia, Houston. We'd like your PRD readouts when possible, and we've checked over your EM dump. It all looks okay.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. We'd like your PRD readout, and we have double checked your EM dump. It all looks okay. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Understand our E memory dump was good. CDR's dosimeter is 11014.


LMP (TRANQ)
And LMP is 09011.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. Break. Columbia, we would like for you to REACQ with your high gain; attempt a manual lock on. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
...


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility here. The LMP's readout may possibly be 09017. Over.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Roger. 09017 is an update on your readout.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Columbia's in high gain.


LMP (TRANQ)
I'll let you know for sure when it goes to either 12 or 18.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Roger. The medics report your latter reading, 17, appears to be the correct one. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Columbia's in the high gain.


CC
Roger, Columbia. You're sounding much better now.







CC
Columbla, Houston. Request P00 in ACCEPT, and we'll uplink another state vector. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Going P00 in ACCEPT.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Suggest you put BATT A on your BATT relay bus. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay.


CC
Columbia, Houston. We're through with your computer. You can go to BLOCK.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. BLOCK.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Go ahead, Houston. Tranquility Base.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We've reviewed the checklist, and about the only change in order to advance the EVA that we've found is that you'll want to delay your lithium hydroxide change until after the EVA rather than before. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. We'd just as soon make a change and jettison the old one. Over.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We would like to delay that LOIO - LiOH change until after the EVA. There is a possibility you could jettison the canister when you jettison your PLSS. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
All right. We'll plan it that way. Over.


CC
Roger, Tranquility.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)

That's about ready to fall off.


CDR (TRANQ)
As a matter of fact, it just doesn't look like it sunk in at all.

CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We'd like some estimate of how far along you are with your eating and when you may be ready to start you EVA PREP. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
I think that we'll be ready to start EVA PREP in about a half an hour or so.







CC
Roger, Tranquility.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. How do you read?


CC
Columbia, Columbia. This is Houston.


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, this is Tranquility Base. We are beginning our EVA PREP.


CC
Tranquility Base, this is Houston, Roger. Copy. You're beginning EVA PREP. Break. Break. Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
You're loud and clear. The waste water dump is down to 10 percent. I have a question on the P22. Do you want me to do another P22, or is all that information just for my own use in tracking the LM for photographic purposes?


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. We request that you perform another P22. We'd like you to let the AUTO optics take care of the tracking and devote your energies to trying to pick out the LM on the lunar surface. If you can find the LM, of course. We're looking for marks on it; but tracking of geographical features doesn't do us all that much good. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Fine. I'll do it. And on the ECS system, the - Whatever the problem was, it seems to have gone away without any changing of J52 sensors or anything like that. My glycol evaporator outlet TEMP is up above 50 now, and it's quite comfortable in the cockpit; so we'll talk more about that one later.


CC
Roger, Columbia. Did you shift into manual control, or did the problem resolve itself under AUTO control? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
The problem went away under AUTO.


Oh 10 12 55        CC
Roger. That's the best type. Out.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
I did cycle out of AUTO into - I did cycle out of AUTO into MANUAL, back into AUTO.







CC
Houston. Roger. Out.


CC
Tranquility Base, Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Tranquility, this is Houston. We need a second set of PRD readings so that we may establish a rate. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Stand by.


CDR (TRANQ)
CDR is reading 11O14.


LMP (TRANQ)
LMP is reading 09017 and three quarters.


CC
Tranquility, this is Houston. We copy your readings, Out.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. How do you read on OMNI D, Dog?


CC
Columbia, this is Hounton. We're reading you loud with background noise on OMNI D. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. I'll stay on D here for a while. I'm about to go into ...


CC
Roger. Out.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. I'm coming up on my time for the first pass when I may - -


CC
Now while we've got time, you can.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
- - be able to see the LM. Do you have any topographical cue that might help me out here? AUTO optics is tracking between two craters. One of them, as the LM sees it, would be long at 11 o'clock. The other would be short and behind him at 5 o'clock. They're great big old craters - depressions.


CC
Stand by.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. The best we can do on topo features is to advise you to look to the west of the irregularly shaped crater, and then work on down to the southwest of it. Over.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Another possibility is the southern rim of the southern of the two oldlooking craters. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger, Houston. Columbia ... I kept my eyes glued to the sextant that time hoping I'd get a flash of reflected light off the LM, but I wasn't able to see any of my scan areas that you suggested.


CC
Roger. On that southern of the old craters, there's a small bright crater on the southern rim. One plot would put him slightly to the west of that small bright crater, about 500 to 1000 feet. Do you see anything down there? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Its going past now, Bruce, but I scanned that area that you are talking about very closely, and no, I did not see anything.


CC
Roger. Out.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. On your LAM 2 map, we'd like to confirm the topographical area in which you were looking on this last period of sightings. As we understand you, you were looking in the vicinity of Papa 7 to November 8. Is that correct? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Stand by one.


CC
Roger.







CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia.


CC
Go ahead, Columbia.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
One of the craters I was talking about is located exactly at Mike 6.7.


CC
Roger. We found that one.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
The other one is located at 7 - The other one is located at 7.2, two thirds of the way from Mike to Nan.


CC
Roger. We believe you were looking a little too far to the west and south. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Understand. I was looking where auto optics was tracking, on the average, and understand that it should have been more to the north and more to the west; actually a tiny bit outside the circle, huh?


CC
More to the north and a little more to the east. The feature that I was describing to you, the small bright crater on the rim of the large, fairly old crater, would be about Mike 0.8 and 8.2. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Well, just give me your best estimate as to his location and his coordinate system, and I'll plot it on my map and go from there.


CC
Roger.


CC
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Can you give us some idea of where you are in the surface checklist at the present time? Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. We're at the top of page 27.


CC
Roger. Out


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. Over.


CC
Go ahead, Columbia.







CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. I finally got you back on OMNI D. I've been unsuccessfully trying to get you on the high gain, and I've gone COMMAND RESET to PROCESS. How do you read me now?


CC
Roger. Reading you loud with background noise. Understand that's 0MNI Delta or 0MNI Bravo? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
0MNI Delta and you were cut out. I never got your coordinates on estimated LM position. Over.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Estimated LM position is latitude plus 0.799, longitude over 2 plus 11.730. On your chart we would place it - Stand by on the charts and readback on the latitude and longitude.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes. The latitude and longitude over 2, 799 and 11730 are the ones that I been using in P22. But what I'm interested in is - is grid coordinates on that map we're using.


CC
Roger. We'll have them for you in a second.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Thank you.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. Could you enable the S band relay at least one way from Eagle to Columbia so I can hear what's going on?


CC
Roger. There's not much going on at the present time, Columbia. I'll see what I can do about the relay.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Are you aware that Eagle plans the EVA about 4 hours early? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Affirmative. When's hatch open time in GET estinated?


CC
Roger. Somewhere around 108 hours. We'll have an update for you on that a little later.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
0kay. I haven't heard a word from those guys, and I thought I'd be hearing them through your S band relay.







CC
Roger. They're on about page Surface 27 in the checklist, proceeding in good time.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Glad to hear it.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
You got a crowd there in MCC?


CC
Roger. You're last, Columbia.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. I expect you probably have about nine CAP COMMS and 11 Flight Directors with no place to plug in.


CC
Roger. Out.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
That ratio might even be reversed.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Glycol evaporator outlet temperature is 50 degrees and the comfort in here is just fine.


CC
Roger. We copy 50 degrees on the glycol, and comfort index fine.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
If you'll excuse me a minute, I'm going to have a cup of coffee.


CC
Roger.


CC
Apollo - Columbia, this is Houston. Your map coordinates are Papa decimal 2 and 6 decimal 3 on the LAM 2 chart. Over.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Did you copy the coordinates for the LM? Over.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. If you read we request high gain antenna, yaw 180, pitch 0. I say again, yaw 180, pitch 0 on the high gain. Over.


CC

CC
Roger, Mike. I have the coordinates - -


CMP (COLUMBIA)
What's new?


CC
Well, what's new is I think we have some more coordinates for you on the LM location. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Ready to copy.


CC
Roger, Mike. Papa 0.2 and 6.3 on your LAM 2 chart. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Papa 0.2 and who 0.3?


CC
6.3, I say again, 6.3.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Thank you. Papa 0.2 and 6.3. I'll try them.


CC
Roger.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. What you are saying is, if you look at the cat's paw, then that's just about, oh - his middle finger, a little bit - one to two o'clock from his middle finger. Is that right?


CC
Roger. About one to two o'clock from the middle finger if you are using 12 o'clock being to the west. 0ver.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
That must be the way the cat's faced. Okay. I'm with you.


CC
Okay. And I got LOS amd A0S times for you.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. Your LOS at 107 plus 23 plus 03. A0S at 108 plus 09 plus 06. The next pass for







COAS tracking: your time of closest approach is 108 35 28. That's 3 miles south of track. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
I understand all that, but with this new information would you like me to try P22 and look for him in a different spot?


CC
Stand by a minute, please.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Because I was looking in the wrong place last time. AUTO optics was not pointing me at the coordinates you gave me.


CC
Roger.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead.


CC
On your next pass, Columbia, rather than performing a P22 as such, we would like you to look in the vicinity of the coordinates that we gave you, which is our best analysis based on map physics and the trajectory, and we also have another set of coordinates that we would like you to search in the vicinity of. This last one being based on all interpretation of the geological features that were seen by the crew on their way down. The coordinates of this second site are Mike 0.7 and 8.0. I say again, Mike 0.7 and 8.0. I say again, Mike 0.7 and 8.0. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Copy. Mike 0.7 and 8.0. The only thing is, my best tool for looking is the sextant and if I'm going to crank the sextant up, I might as well let P22 go at the same time, or don't you think so?


CC
Roger. If you want to go that way, crank it up and then you can drive it around and look where you want. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay.


CC
And if you can find the LM, then by all means, track it or make a note of where it was and we







can track it on the next REV. If you are ready, we have a REFSMMAT update that we can pass up to you at this time, if you will give us P00 in ACCEPT. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. P00 in ACCEPT you got. And this is an updated landing site RESFMMAT. We still believe that a plane change is not required. Is that affirmative?


CC
That's affirmative, Columbia.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Good show.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. We are through with the uplink. It's your computer.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Thank you.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia.


CC
Go ahead, Columbia.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
On our next pass, I'd appreciate the S band relay mode. Over.


CC
Roger. We're working on that. There haven't been any transmissions from Tranquility Base since we last talked to you. We cannot give you a full S band relay without being assured of high gain antenna. We're working on the partial relay for you. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Understand, Bruce. Thank you very much.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Approximately 2 minutes to LOS. All your systems are looking good from down here. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Does it look to you like the 240 controller is properly controlling the glycol evaporator outlet TEMP? It locks all right up here.


CC
Roger, Columbia. During this pass on the front side, it looked okay to us.

Now, if you'll pull the RCU down.


LMP (TRANQ)
Wonder if we're triggering all the time.


CDR (TRANQ)
I don't think so.


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, Neil. How do you read?


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Read you loud and clear and I read both the comments that said: "I wonder if we're triggering all the time" and "I don't think so." Prior to that it was relatively quiet. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. We're hearing a little bit of background noise, and I just wanted to make sure that we weren't continually keyed.


CC
Don't sound like it.


CDR (TRANQ)
Want to put the light back up?


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Would you verify your RCU vent window's clear? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
That's verified.


CC

Okay. It is stowed. All right, PREP for EVA.


LMP (TRANQ)
First you connect the water hose.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Let me get yours.







LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Now we should be able to stow these. Huh?


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Any joy on the LM that pass? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. They're all stowed. Connect PLSS water hose to PGA. Let's see; let me do that.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. That's in and locked.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, Buzz here. Over.


CC
Go ahead, Buzz. This is Houston.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Our COMM just seemed to clear up a good bit. Did CSM just go over the hill?


CC
Negative. He's been over the hill, here, for a minute or so.

CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. Go ahead.


CC
Roger. Were you successful in spotting the LM on that pass? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
That's negative. I checked both locations, and no joy.


CC
Okay. If you'd like to look again next pass, we have a different set of coordinates based on the onboard P57 solution of the LM. These are Echo 0.3 and 4.8. I say again Echo 0.3, 4.8, same chart. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. I'll look there. And, also, how about putting that in your machine and coming out with some coordinates: latitude and longitude over 2, and altitude for P22, so it can help me as best it can.


CC
Roger.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
That P22 is still pointing in the wrong way.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Latitude plus 0.523, longitude divided by 2, 11.710. Over.

Okay. That's a little bit better now. There we go.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Read you and clear.


LMP (TRANQ)
You're not too loud and clear, but I think it's the same problem. Houston, how do you read Buzz?


CC
Buzz, this is Houston. Loud and clear. You're really coming in beautifully. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Very good.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Cabin REPRESS closed.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay.


CDR (TRANQ)
Now. Now for the gymnastics.


LMP (TRANQ)
What?


CDR (TRANQ)
Now comes the gymnastics.


LMP (TRANQ)
Oh, I think it'll be a lot easier.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay, I want to go to DUMP and go down to 3.5 and back to AUTO.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay, Going dump and it's down to 4.2, 4.1, - -


CDR (TRANQ)
That's 3.5. Are you in AUTO? Verify cabin pressure at 3.5 and LM suit circuit pressure between 3.6 and 4.3.


LMP (TRANQ)
It is. Suit circuit's at about 43.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Verify the PGA pressure is above 45, minus 46.


LMP (TRANQ)
Minus 47.







CC
Neil, this is Houston. Will you give us hack when you start - -


CDR (TRANQ)
***


CC

LMP (TRANQ)
Give it to them later.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Okay, let's go to dump.


LMP (TRANQ)
Dump. Go to dump.


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, I'll set my watch at 56. Over.

Houston, Columbia is back on the high gain.


CC
Roger, Columbia. Loud and clear. And we copied you Mark there, Buzz.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. I've got my water warning.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Water warning.


CDR (TRANQ)
Is that yours?


LMP (TRANQ)
Yes. Got mine.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Cabin pressure going towards zero. Verify LM suit circuit 36 to 43. That's verified. FIPGA pressure above 4.5. Okay. 4.7, coming down. Ready to open the hatch when we get to zero.


LMP (TRANQ)
You want to bring down one of your visors now or leave them up? I'll read *** okay.


CDR (TRANQ)
Inner visor down.


CDR (TRANQ)
Four tenths of a pound in the cabin.


CDR (TRANQ)
Down to about 0,2.


LMP (TRANQ)
Sure takes a long time to get all the way down, doesn't it?


CDR (TRANQ)
Yes.


LMP (TRANQ)
Let me see if it will open now.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


CDR (TRANQ)
Open my RCU there, would you, Buzz?


CDR (TRANQ)
Push outward.


CDR (TRANQ)
Need some light?


LMP (TRANQ)
It's unlocked, yes.


CDR (TRANQ)
Unlocked.


LMP (TRANQ)
That'll be good enough.


CDR (TRANQ)
It'll pop open.


LMP (TRANQ)
Get a steady tone in the background?


CDR (TRANQ)
I have a - static. A little bit of static.


LMP (TRANQ)
I've got a little bit of a steady tone.


CDR (TRANQ)
I don't guess I hear that.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. What's your status on hatch opening? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Everything is GO here. Me're just waiting for the cabin pressure to bleed so - to blow enough pressure to open the hatch. It's about 0.1 on our gage now.


LMP (TRANQ)
Sure hate to tug on that thing. Alternative would be to open *** too.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. We're showing a relatively static pressure on your cabin. Do you think you can open the hatch at this pressure of about 1.2 psi?


CDR (TRANQ)
We're going to try it.


CC
Roger.


CDR (TRANQ)
The hatch is coming open.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay, Hold it from going closed and I'll get the valve to - -


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


LMP (TRANQ)
No. I'd better get up first.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. The valves in AUTO.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


LMP (TRANQ)
Might want to fill it up to FORWARD.


CDR (TRANQ)
Your window cleared yet? Your water window cleared yet?


LMP (TRANQ)
It was, yes.


CDR (TRANQ)
Mine hasn't cleared yet.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Columbia. Go ahead.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. We'd like you to cycle the fans in CRYO hydrogen tank number 1, and LOS time this orbit is 111 19 31.


CC
Correction - Make that for the next orbit. You already have the AOS/LOS for this orbit.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger on time, and you want to cycle the fan in CRYO hydrogen tank 1.


CC
Roger. Out.


CDR (TRANQ)
Have you got your water valve on there?


LMP (TRANQ)
Yes.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. We show you nearing high gain antenna scan limits. When you lose lock on us, we request OMNI Delta. OMNI Delta when you lose lock. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. 0MNI Delta.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. My window's cleared. I'm going to go to turn my cooling up a little bit.







LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. My window's clear.


CDR (TRANQ)
All RCU windows are clear. And suit circuit is 42 - 43. And I got ascent pressure light, a VF light, and a ECS light.


LMP (TRANQ)
And we've got a water separater light. Hold it and I'll check.


CDR (TRANQ)
All right.


LMP (TRANQ)
And I'll look at your cabin fan 1 circuit breaker, and you look at glycol secondary.


LMP (TRANQ)
I've got good cooling now.


CDR (TRANQ)
Me, too.

Okay. PGNS radar circuit breaker's open.


LMP (TRANQ)
Well, I'm looking head on at it. I'll get it.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Let's get your antenna.


LMP (TRANQ)
You'll have to fix my antenna.


CDR (TRANQ)
Well, ready? - -


LMP (TRANQ)
About ready to go down and get some Moon rock?


CDR (TRANQ)
My antenna's out. Okay. Now we're ready to hook up the LEC here.


LMP (TRANQ)
All right. That should go down with no twists at all. Put the bag up this way, that's even. Neil, are you hooked up to it?


CDR (TRANQ)
Yes. Okay. Now we need to hook this.


LMP (TRANQ)
Move that up there.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Your visor.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Your back is up against the purse. All right. Now it's on top of the DSKY. Forward and up; now you are clear. Little bit toward me. Straight down, to your left a little bit. Plenty of room. Neil, you're lined up nicely. Toward me a little bit, down. Okay. Now you're clear. You're catching the first hinge on the bottom.


CDR (TRANQ)
What hinge?


LMP (TRANQ)
All right. Move, here roll to the left. Okay. Now you're clear. You're lined up on the platform. Put your left foot to the right a little bit. Okay. That's good. Roll left, Good.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Now I'm going to check PLSS here.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. You're not quite squared away. Roll to the - roll right a little. Now you're even.

Okay. Houston, I'm on the porch.


CC
Roger, Neil.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Stand by, Neil.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. One minute and 30 seconds to LOS. All systems GO. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Columbia. Thank you.


LMP (TRANQ)
Stay where you are a minute, Neil.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Need a little slack?


CDR (TRANQ)
You need more slack, Buzz?


LMP (TRANQ)
No. Hold it just a minute.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Everything's nice and straight in here.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Can you pull the door open a little more?


LMP (TRANQ)
All right.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


LMP (TRANQ)
Did you get the MESA out?


CDR (TRANQ)
I'm going to pull it now.


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, the MESA came down all right.


CC
This is Houston, Roger. We copy. And we're standing by for your TV.


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, this is Neil. Radio check.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Loud and clear. Break. Break. Buzz, this is Houston. Radio check, and verify TV circuit breaker in.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger, TV circuit breaker's in, and read you five square.


CC
Roger. We're getting a picture on the TV.


LMP (TRANQ)
You got a good picture, huh?


CC
There's a great deal of contrast in it, and currently it's upside down on our monitor, but we can make out a fair amount of detail.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Will you verify the position - the opening I ought to have on the camera?


CC
Stand by.


CC
Okay. Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. I just checked getting back up to that first step, Buzz. It's - not even collapsed too far, but it's adequate to get back up.







CC
Roger. We copy.


CDR (TRANQ)
It takes a pretty good little jump.


Oh 13 23 25        CC
Buzz, this is Houston. F/2 - 1/160th second for shadow photography on the sequence camera.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay.


CDR (TRANQ)
I'm at the foot of the ladder. The LM footpads are only depressed in the surface about 1 or 2 inches, although the surface appears to be very, very fine grained, as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. Down there, it's very fine.


CDR (TRANQ)
I'm going to step off the LM now.


CDR (TRANQ)
THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR (A) MAN, ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND.


CDR (TRANQ)
And the - the surface is fine and powdery. I can - I can pick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers like powdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. We're copying.


CDR (EVA)
There seems to be no difficulty in moving around as we suspected. It's even perhaps easier than the simulations at one sixth g that we performed in the various simulations on the ground. It's actually no trouble to walk around. Okay. The descent engine did not leave a crater of any size. It has about 1 foot clearance on the ground. We're essentially on a very level place here. I can see some evidence of rays emanating from the descent engine, but a very insignificant amount.


CDR (EVA)
Okay, Buzz, we ready to bring down the camera?


LMP (EVA)
I'm all ready. I think it's been all squared away and in good shape.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.







LMP (EVA)
Okay. You'll have to pay out all the LEC. It looks like it's coming out nice and evenly.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. It's quite dark here in the shadow and a little hard for me to see that I have good footing. I'll work my way over into the sunlight here without looking directly into the Sun.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. It's taut now.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I think you're pulling the wrong one.


CDR (EVA)
I'm just - Okay. I'm ready to pull it down now. There was still a little bit left in the -


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Don't hold it quite so tight.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


CDR (EVA)
Looking up at the LM, I'm standing directly in tne shadow now looking up at Buzz in the window. And I can see everything quite clearly. The light is sufficiently bright backlighted into the front of the LM, that everything is very clearly visible,


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I'm going to be changing the ***


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


CDR (EVA)
The camera is installed on the RCU bracket, and I'm storing the LEC on the secondary strut.


CDR (EVA)
I'll step out and take some of my first pictures here.


CC
Roger. Neil, we're reading you loud and clear. We see you getting some pictures and the contingency sample.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Did you copy about the contingency sample? Over.


CDR (EVA)
Roger. I'm going to get to that just as soon as I finish these picture series.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Going to get the contingency sample there, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Right.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. That's good.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. The contingency sample is down and it's ***. Looks like it's a little difficult to dig through the initial crust.


CDR (EVA)
This is very interesting. It's a very soft surface, but here and there where I plug with the contingency sample collector, I run into a very hard surface, but it appears to be very cohesive material of the same sort. I'll try to get a rock in here. Just a couple.


LMP (EVA)
That looks beautiful from here, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
It has a stark beauty all its own. It's like much of the high desert of the United States. It's different but it's very pretty out here. Be advised that a lot of the rock samples out here, the hard rock samples, have what appear to be vesicles in the surface. Also, I am looking at one now that appears to have some sort of phenocryst.


CC
Houston. Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. The handle is off the *** in about 6 or 8 inches into the surface. I could *** easy ***.


CDR (EVA)
Yes, it is. it's - I'm sure I could push it in farther, but it's hard for me to bend down further than that.


LMP (EVA)
Now, you can throw so far.


CDR (EVA)
You can really throw things a long way up here.


CDR (EVA)
That pocket open, Buzz?


LMP (EVA)
Yes, it is. It's not up against your suit though. Hit it back once more. More toward the inside. Okay. That's good.


CDR (EVA)
That in the pocket?


LMP (EVA)
Yes. Push down.


CDR (EVA)
Got it?


LMP (EVA)
No. It's not all the way in. Push it. There you go.


CDR (EVA)
Contingency sample is in the pocket. My oxygen is 81 percent. I have no flags, and I'm in minimum flow.


CC
This is Houston. Roger, Neil.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I have got the cameras on at one frame a second.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
And I've got the 80 percent, no flags.


CDR (EVA)
Are you getting a TV picture now, Houston?


CC
Neil, yes we are getting a TV picture.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. We're getting a picture. You're not in it at the present time. We can see the bag on the LEC being moved by Buzz, though. Here you come into our field of view.


CDR (EVA)
...


LMP (EVA)
Roger.


CDR (EVA)
Hold it a second. First let me move that over the edge for you.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Are you ready for me to come out?


CDR (EVA)
Yes. Just stand by a second. I'll move this over the handrail.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
All right. That's got it. Are you ready?


CDR (EVA)
All set. Okay. You saw what difficulties I was having. I'll try to watch your PLSS from underneath here.


END OF TAPE

LMP (EVA)
All right. The backup camera's positioned.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. Your PLSS is - Looks like it is clearing okay. Your toes are about to come over the sill. Okay. Now drop your PLSS down. There you go; you're clear. And laterally you're good. You've got an inch clearance on top of your PLSS.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. You need a little bit of arching of the back to come down. ... How are are my feet from the edge?


CDR (EVA)
Okay. You're right at the edge of the porch.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Back in *** little of foot movement *** porch. Little arching of the back. Helmet comes up and clears the bulkhead without any trouble at all.


CDR (EVA)
Looks good.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Based on your camera transfer with the LEC, do you foresee any difficulties in SRC transfer? Over.


CDR (EVA)
Negative.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Now I want to back up and partially close the hatch.


LMP (EVA)
Making sure not to lock it on my way out.


CDR (EVA)
(Laughter) A pretty good thought.


LMP (EVA)
That's our home for the next couple of hours and we want to take good care of it. Okay. I'm on the top step and I can look down over the RCU, landing gear pads. It's a very simple matter to hop down from one step to the next.


CDR (EVA)
Yes. I found I could be very comfortable, and walking is also very comfortable.


CDR (EVA)
You've got three more steps and then a long one.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I'm going to leave that one foot up there and both hands down to about the fourth rung up.


CDR (EVA)
There you go.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Now I think I'll do the same ***


CDR (EVA)
A little more. About another inch.


CDR (EVA)
THERE YOU GOT IT.


CDR (EVA)
That's a good step. About a 3-footer.


LMP (EVA)
Beautiful view!


CDR (EVA)
Isn't that something! Magnificent sight out here.


LMP (EVA)
Magnificent desolation.


LMP (EVA)
Looks like the secondary strut *** little thermal effects on it right here, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Yes. I noticed that. That seems to be the worst, although similar effects are on - all around.

MS
... powder, isn't it?


CDR (EVA)
Isn't it fine?


LMP (EVA)
Right in this area I don't think there's much of any *** fine powder *** clods together, and it's hard to tell whether it's a clod or a rock.


CDR (EVA)
Notice how you can kick it out.


LMP (EVA)
Yes. And it bounces and then -


LMP (EVA)
Reaching down is fairly easy. I got my suit dirty at this stage.


LMP (EVA)
The mass of the backpack does have some effect in inertia.


LMP (EVA)
There's a slight tendency, I can see now, to *** backwards *** due to the soft, very soft texture.


CDR (EVA)
You're standing on a rock, a big rock there now.


LMP (EVA)
This pad sure didn't ***


CDR (EVA)
No. It didn't.


LMP (EVA)
There's absolutely no crater there at all from the engine.


CDR (EVA)
No.


LMP (EVA)
I wonder if about right under the engine is where the probe might have hit.


CDR (EVA)
I'd like that.


CDR (EVA)
Yes. I think that's a good representation of our sideward velocity at touchdown there - hole at the probe.


LMP (EVA)
I see that probe over on the minus-Y strut. It's broken off and bent back up.


CDR (EVA)
It did, didn't it? The other two both bent over.


LMP (EVA)
Can't say too much for the visibility right here without the visor up. It's dark. It looks like there is a *** surface of it is *** pounded rock *** And incidentally, these rocks *** very powdery surface ***


CC
Say again, please, Buzz; you're cutting out.


LMP (EVA)
I say that the rocks are rather slippery.


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
A powdery surface when the sun hits. *** they split up all the very little fine porouses *** Will tend to slide over it rather easily.


LMP (EVA)
Traction *** seems quite good. ***


LMP (EVA)
*** About to lose my balance in one direction and recovery is a quite natural and very easy *** And, moving your arms around, Jack, doesn't *** off the surface *** not quite that light-footed.


CDR (EVA)
And, I have the insulation off the MESA now and MESA seems to be in good shape.


LMP (EVA)
Got to be careful that you are leaning in the direction you want to go, otherwise you *** slightly inebriated. In other words, you have to cross your foot over to stay underneath where your center-of-mass is.


LMP (EVA)
And, Neil, didn't I say we might see some purple rocks?


CDR (EVA)
Find a purple rock?


LMP (EVA)
Yes. They are small, sparkly *** fragments *** places *** would make a first guess that some sort of biotite *** We'll leave that to further analysis ***


LMP (EVA)
*** compact underneath *** completely no *** you don't sink down more than ... a quarter of an inch.


CDR (EVA)
Okay, Houston. I'm going to change lenses on you.


CC
Roger, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Okay, Houston. Tell me if you're getting a new picture.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. That's affirmative. We're getting a new picture. You can tell it's a longer focal length lens. And for your information, all LM systems are GO. Over.


LMP (EVA)
We appreciate that. Thank you.


LMP (EVA)
Neil is now unveiling the plaque *** gear.


CC
Roger. We got you boresighted, but back under one track.


CDR (EVA)
For those who haven't read the plaque, we'll read the plaque that's on the front landing gear of this LM. First there's two hemispheres, one showing each of the two hemispheres of the Earth. Underneath it says "Here Man from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind." It has the crew members' signatures and the signature of the President of the United States.


CDR (EVA)
Ready for the camera?


LMP (EVA)
No. I'll get it. No, you take this TV on out.


CDR (EVA)
Watch the LEC, there.


LMP (EVA)
Now I'm afreid these ... materials are going to get dusty ***


LMP (EVA)
The surface material is powdery. *** How good your lens is, but if you can *** smudges ... very much like a very finely powdered carbon, but it's very pretty looking.


CDR (EVA)
Would you pull out some of my cable for me, Buzz?


LMP (EVA)
Houston. How close are you able to get things in focus ?


CC
This is Houston. We can see Buzz's right hand. It is somewhat out of focus. I'd say we were focusing down to probably - oh, about 8 inches to a foot behind the position of his hand when he was pulling out the cable.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. How's the temperature on there?


CDR (EVA)
Temperature of the camera is showing zero.


LMP (EVA)
I'm a little cool. I think I'll trade ***


LMP (EVA)
I'm on intermediate now, Houston, and I show 3.78. No flags, 70 ***


CC
Houston. Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
And, we'll probably need a little *** distance *** back location *** television camera.


LMP (EVA)
Neil, look at the minus Y-strut, the direction of travel there *** travel from right to left.


CDR (EVA)
Right.


LMP (EVA)
This one over here underneath the ascent engine where the probe first hit - the minus-Y probe first hit.


CDR (EVA)
I got plenty of cable?


LMP (EVA)
You've got plenty. Plenty more.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I think I've got the end of it.


CDR (EVA)
Something interesting: in the bottom of this little crater here - It may be -


LMP (EVA)
Now keep going. We've got a lot more.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Getting a little harder to pull out, here.


CDR (EVA)
How far would you say I am, Buzz?


LMP (EVA)
Forty, 50 feet. Why don't you turn around and let them get a view from there and see what the field of view looks like?


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
You're backing into the cable.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Turn around to your right, would be better.


CDR (EVA)
I don't want to go into the Sun if I can avoid it.


LMP (EVA)
That's right. Yes.


CDR (EVA)
I'll just leave it - -


LMP (EVA)
- - All right.


CDR (EVA)
- - sit like that and walk around it.


LMP (EVA)
Houston. How's that field of view going to pick up the MESA? *** far away?


CC
Roger.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. The field of view is okay. We'd like you to aim it a little bit more to the right. Over.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. That's all the cable we have. *** not going out. I'll start working on the solar wind - -


CC
A little bit too much to the right. Can you bring it back left about 4 or 5 Degrees?


CC
Okay. That looks good Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Okay, now. Do you think I ought to be farther away, or closer?


LMP (EVA)
Can't get too much further away.


CDR (EVA)
Let's try it like that for a while. I'll get a couple of panoramas with it, here.


CC
Roger. You look okay as far as distance goes, Neil. And we'll line you up again when you finish the panorama. Now you're going too fast on the panorama sweep. You're going to have to stop, or -


CDR (EVA)
I haven't stopped - I haven't set it down yet. That's the first picture in the panorama. Right there.


CC
Roger.


CDR (EVA)
It's taken just a little - about north, north east.


CDR (EVA)
Tell me if you've got a picture, Houston.


CC
We've got a beautiful picture, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. I'm going to move it.


CC
Okay. Here's another good one.


CC
Okay, we got that one.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. Now, this one is right down front, straight west. And I want to know if you can see an angular rock in the foreground.


CC
Roger. We have a large angular rock in the foreground, and it looks like a much smaller rock a couple of inches to the left of it. Over.


CDR (EVA)
All right. And then on beyond it about 10 feet is an even larger rock that's very rounded. That rock is about - The closest one to you is about sticking out of the sand about 1 foot. And it's about a foot and one half long, and it's about 6 inches thick, but it's standing on edge.


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
Okay, Neil. I've got the table out and the bag deployed.


CC
We've got this view, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
This is straight south.


CC
Roger. And we see the shadow of the LM.


CDR (EVA)
Roger. The little hill just beyond the shadow of the LM is a pair of elongate craters about - probably the pair together is about 40 feet long and 20 feet across, and they're probably 6 feet deep. We'll probably get some more work in there later.


CC
Roger. We see Buzz going about his work.


CDR (EVA)
How's that for a final?


CC
For a final orientation, we'd like it to come left about 5 degrees. Over.


CC
Now back to the right about half as much.


CDR
Okay?


CC
Okay. That looks good there, Neil.







CDR (EVA)
Okay.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. You can make a Mark, Houston. *** deployed.


CC
Roger. Solar wind.


LMP (EVA)
And, incidently, you can use the shadow that the staff makes to *** getting it perpendicular ***


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
Some of these small depressions *** tend to sink - oh, maybe 2 or 3 inches. *** suggest exactly what the Surveyor pictures showed when they pushed away a little bit. You get a force transmitted through the upper surface of the soil and about 5 or 6 inches of bay breaks loose and moves as if it were caked on the surface, when in fact it really isn't.


CDR (EVA)
I noticed in the soft spots where we had footprints nearly an inch deep that the soil is very cohesive and it will retain a - will retain a slope of probably 70 degrees along side of the footprints.


CDR (EVA)
Okay?


LMP (EVA)
Yes. I think that's excellent.


LMP (EVA)
They didn't come off?


LMP (EVA)
*** get the ***


CDR (EVA)
*** that part? *** a rock here.


LMP (EVA)
You'll have to extend that one.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


LMP (EVA)
***


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia on the high gain. Over.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes. Reading you loud and clear. How's it going?


CC
Roger. The EVA is progressing beautifully. I believe they are setting up the flag now.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Great.


CC
I guess you're about the only person around that doesn't have TV coverage of the scene.


04 14 09 25 CMP (COLUMBIA)
That's all right. I don't mind a bit.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
How is the quality of the TV?


CC
Oh, it's beautiful, Mike. It really is.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Oh, gee, that's great! Is the lighting half way decent?


CC
Yes, indeed. They've got the flag up now and you can see the stars and stripes on the lunar surface.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Beautiful. Just beautiful.


LMP (EVA)
That's good. See if you can pull that end off a little bit. Take that end up a little.


CDR (EVA)
It won't pull out.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.


CDR (EVA)
Roger, Houston. Loud and clear.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
Loud and clear, Houston.


CC
Roger, Buzz.


LMP (EVA)
I'd like to evaluate the various paces that a person can *** traveling on the lunar surface. I believe I'm out of your field of view. Is that right, now, Houston?


CC
That's affirmative, Buzz.


CC
You are in our field of view now.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. You do have to be rather careful to keep track of where your center of mass is. Sometimes, it takes about two or three paces to make sure you've got your feet underneath you.


LMP (EVA)
About two to three or maybe four easy paces can bring you to a nearly smooth stop. *** change directions, like a football player, you just have to to *** foot out to the side and cut a little bit.


LMP (EVA)
So called kangeroo hop does work, but it seems that your forward mobility is not quite as good as - it is in the conventional - more conventional one foot after another.


LMP (EVA)
It's hard saying what a sane pace might be. I think it's the one that I'm using now - would get rather tiring after several hundred *** but this may be a function of this suit, as well as lack of gravity forces.


CC
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Could we get both of you on the camera for a minute, please?


CDR (EVA)
Say again, Houston.


CC
Roger. We'd like to get both of you in the field of view of the camera for a minute.


CC
Neil and Buzz, the President of the United States is in his office now and would like to say a few words to you. Over.


CDR (EVA)
That would be an honor.


CC
Go ahead, Mr. President. This is Houston. Out.


THE FOLLOWING IS A MESSAGE FROM RICHARD M. NIXON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES; THE MESSAGE ORIGINATED FROM THE OVAL ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA


PRESIDENT NIXON
Neil and Buzz, I am talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone


call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you *** for every American. This has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they, too, join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one; one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.


CDR (EVA)
Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here representing not only the United States but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and a curiosity and a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.


PRESIDENT NIX0N
And thank you very much and I look forward - All of us look forward to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.


LMP (EVA)
I look forward to that very much, sir.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Loud and clear, Houston.


CC
Roger. I got a P22 AUTO optics - AUTO optics PAD for you.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Go ahead.


CC
Roger. P22 landmark ID, LM: T1, 110 26 56; T2, 110 32 06. Three miles south; time of closest approach, 110 33 40. Shaft 353.855, trunnion 46.495, roll zero, pitch 250, yaw zero. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Thank you. Readback not required.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
Houston, it's very interesting to note that when I kick my foot *** with no atmosphere here, and this gravity *** they seem to leave, and most of them have about the same angle of departure and velocity. From where I stand, a large portion of them will impact at a certain distance out. Several *** the percentage is, of course, that will impact *** different regions *** it's highly dependent upon *** the initial trajectory upward *** where most of the *** already the particles are found, ... terrain.


CC
Roger, Buzz. And break. Break. Columbia, this is Houston. When you track out of high gain antenna, then let's request OMNI Delta, OMNI Delta. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
So be it.


LMP (EVA)
I've noticed several times in going from the sunlight into the shadow, that just as I go in, I catch an additional reflection off the LM *** along with the reflection off my face onto the visor, makes visibility very poor just at the transition *** sunlight into the shadow. I essentially have so much glare coming onto my visor *** shadow *** helmet actually gets the shadow. Than it takes a short while for my eyes to adapt to the lighting conditions. *** inside the shadow area, visibility, as we said before, is not too great, but both visor's up *** what sort of footprints we have and the general condition of the soil. Then, after being out in the sunlight a while, it takes - Watch it, Neil! Neil, you're on the cable.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Yes. Lift up your right foot, right foot. It's still - your toe is still hooked in it.


CDR (EVA)
That one?


LMP (EVA)
Yes. It's still hooked in it. Wait a minute. Okay. You're clear now.


CDR (EVA)
Thank you.


LMP (EVA)
Now, let's move that over this way.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I've got it.


LMP (EVA)
The blue color of my boots has completely disappeared now into this *** still don't know exactly what color to describe this other than ash cocoa color. It seems to be covering most of the lighter part of the boot *** color that *** very fine particles ***.


CC
Buzz, this is Houston. You're cutting out on the end of your transmissions. Can you speak a little more closely into your microphone? Over.


LMP (EVA)
Roger. I'll try that.


CC
Beautiful.


LMP (EVA)
Well, I had that one inside my mouth that time.


CC
It sounded a little wet.


LMP (EVA)
In general, time spent in the shadow doesn't seem to have any *** thermal effects. *** inside the suit. There is a difference, of course, in the ... radiation and the helmet. So I think there's a tendency to feel a little cooler in the shadow than the Sun.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia in Delta.


CC
Roger. You should have VHF AOS with the LM right about now. VHF LOS will be about 40 minutes 15 seconds. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Thank you.


LMP (EVA)
As I look around the area, the contrast, in general, is *** comes about completely by virtue of the shadow *** down Sun ... very light colored gray, light gray color, a halo around my own shadow, around the shadow of my helmet. Then, as I look off across *** the contrast becomes strongest in that the surrounding color is still fairly light. As you look down into the Sun *** a larger amount of *** shadowed area is looking toward us. The general color of the *** surrounding *** the contrast is not as great. Surveying all the dusty area that we've kicked up *** considerably darker in texture. Now, I've kicked up one, and I imagine that this is *** Surveyor. The same is true when I survey across on - along the area that we're walking. In general *** to the fact that there are footprints there. General terrain where I've been kicking up a lot of this surface material is generally of a darker contrast *** color.


LMP (EVA)
The panorama I'll be taking is about 30 or 40 feet out to plus ***


CC
Say again which strut, Buzz?


LMP (EVA)
The plus Z strut.


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
And right in this area, there are two craters. The one that's right in front of me now as I look off in about the eleven o'clock position from the spacecraft, about 30 to 35 feet ... There's several eral rocks and boulders 6 to 8 inches across ... sizes.


LMP (EVA)
I'm now in the area of the minus Y strut taking some ... photographs.


LMP (EVA)
How's the bulk sample coming, Neil?


CDR (EVA)
Bulk sample is just being sealed.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. No marks on the LM that time. I did see a suspiciously small white object whose coordinates are - -


CC
Go ahead with the coordinates on the small white object.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Easy - Easy 0.3, 7.6, but I ... right on the southwest end of a crater. I think they would know it if they were in such a location. It looks like their LM would be pitched up quite a degree. It's on the southwest wall of a smallish crater.


CC
Roger. Copy Echo 0.3 and 7.6, and -


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. While I'm talking to you, LOS will be at 111 19 31; AOS, 112 05 43. Over.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Did you copy LOS AOS times? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Negative, Houston. You broke. Disregard. I'll get them off the flight plans.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
The jet deflector that's mounted on quad 1 seems to be a good bit more wrinkled *** right now on quad 4.


CC
You're breaking up again, Buzz.


LMP (EVA)
I say the jets deflector that's mounted on quad 4 seems to be - the surface of it seems lo be more wrinkled than the one that's on quad 1. Generally, underneath part of the LM seems to have stood up quite well to the *** get some pictures in the aft part of the LM that will illuminate the thermal effects much better than we could get them up here in the front.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
We're going to get some particular photographs of the bulk sample area, Neil?


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
And, Houston? Buzz here. I'm showing 3.78 psi, 63 percent, no flags, adequate, slight warming *** fingered.


CDR (EVA)
Roger. And Neil has 66 percent O2, no flags, minimum cooling, and the suit pressure is 382.


CC
Houston. Roger. Out.


CC
Buzz, this is Houston. Have you removed the closeup camera from the MESA yet? Over.


LMP (EVA)
Negative. Thank you.


LMP (EVA)
*** get the panorama now. Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Did you get it?


CDR (EVA)
Houston, how does our timeline appear to be going?


CC
Roger. It looks like you're about a half hour slow on it. We're working on consumables. Over.


CDR (EVA)
All right.


CC
Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. To clarify my last, your consumables are in good shape at this time. The 30 minute reference was with respect to the nominal timeline. Over.


CDR (EVA)
Roger. I understand that.


CDR (EVA)
I don't note any abnormalities in the LM. The pods seem to be in good shape. The primary and secondary struts are in good shape. Atennas are all in place. There's no evidence of problem underneath the LM due to engine exhaust or drainage of any kind.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
It's very surprising, the very surprising lack of penetration of all four of the foot pads. I'd say if we were to try and determine just how far below the surface they would have penetrated, you'd measure maybe 3 inches, wouldn't you say, Neil?


CDR (EVA)
At the most, yes. That Y strut there is probably even less than that.


LMP (EVA)
Nice paint job.


LMP (EVA)
I get a picture of the plus Y strut taken from near the descent stage, and I think we'll be able to see a little bit better what the thermal effects are. Seem to be quite minimal.


LMP (EVA)
There's one picture taken in the right rear of the spacecraft looking at the skirt of the descent stage, shows a quite darkening of the surface color, a rather minimal amount of radiating or etching away or erosion of the surface. 0n descent, both of us remarked that we could see a large amount of very fine dust particles moving out. It was reported beforehand that we would probably see an upgassing from the surface after actual engine shutdown, but as I recall, I was unable to confirm that.


LMP (EVA)
This is too big an angle, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Yes. I think you are right.


LMP (EVA)
We're back at the minus Z strut now. *** very little force of impact that we actually had.


LMP (EVA)
And, Neil, if you'll take the camera, I'll get to work on the SEQ bay.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. I notice that -


CC
Go ahead, Buzz.


LMP (EVA)
Taking some close up pictures of that rock.


LMP (EVA)
I was saying that, Houston, *** stop and take a photograph or something and then want to start moving again sideways, there's quite a tendency to start doing it with just gradual sideways hops until you start getting ***


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
Can you see us underneath the LM over at the SEQ bay, Houston?


CC
Yes indeed, Buzz. We can see your feet sticking our underneath the structure of the LM descent stage.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I'm just on the other side of the - -


CC
Now we can see you through the structure of the minus Z secondary strut.


LMP (EVA)
All right. The doors are open, and it looks like they are going to stay up without any problem.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. We are about to lose you on the OMNI's. Request high gain antenna, REACQ mode Fish 20, yaw 135. Over.


LMP (EVA)
You want to pick an area, Neil?


CC
Make that yaw 175, Columbia, yaw 175 on the high gain.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Columbia is locked up on the high gain, Houston.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP
Houston, the passive seismometer has been deployed manually.


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
And the manual deployment of the LR cubed, the little spring that is at the end of the string is pulled off of the picks head. However, I was able to reach up and get hold of the picks head and pull it loose. So, it will be deployed manually, also.


CC
Roger.


CDR (EVA)
And, the panorama is complete. *** and the LM - got the LM at 7 30 position at about 60 feet.


CDR (EVA)
And the doors are closed and locked.


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
Have you got us a good area picked out?







CDR (EVA)
Yes. I think right out on that rise out there is probably as good as any.


CDR (EVA)
I'll probably stay on the high ground there and - -


LMP (EVA)
Watch it; the edge of that crater is - drops - -


CDR (EVA)
Yes. It drops off there, doesn't it?


LMP (EVA)
Get a couple of close ups on these quite rounded large boulders.


CDR (EVA)
About 40 feet out - I'd say out at the end of that next - -


LMP (EVA)
It's going to be a little difficult to find a good level spot here.


CDR (EVA)
The top of that next little ridge there. Wouldn't that be a pretty good place?


LMP (EVA)
All right. Should I put the LR cubed right about here?


CDR (EVA)
All right.


LMP (EVA)
I'm going to have to get on the other side of this rock here.


CDR (EVA)
I would go right around that crater to the left there. Isn't that a level spot there?


LMP (EVA)
I think this right here is just as level.


CDR (EVA)
These boulders look like basalt, and they have probably 2 percent white minerals in them, the white crystals. And the thing that I reported as the vesicular before, I'm not - I don't believe I believe that any more. I think that small craters - they look like little impact craters where shot - B B shot has hit the surface.


LMP (EVA)
Houston. I have the seismic experiment flipped over now, and I'm aligning it, but I'm having a little bit of difficulty getting the B B in the center. It wants to move around and around on the outside. ***


CC
You're cutting out again, Buzz.


LMP (EVA)
Roger. I say I'm not having too much success in leveling the PSE experiment.


CDR (EVA)
The laser reflector is installed and the bubble is leveled and the alignment appears to be good.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
Hey, you want to take a look at this B B and see what you make out of it?


CDR (EVA)
I find it pretty hard to get perfectly level, too.


LMP (EVA)
That B B likes the outside. It won't go on the inside.


CDR (EVA)
That little cup is convex now, instead of concave.


LMP (EVA)
I think you're right.


CDR (EVA)
Believe it is.


LMP (EVA)
Houston, I don't think there's any hope for using this leveling device to come up with an accurate level. It looks to me as though the cup here that the B B is in is now convex instead of concave. Over.


CC
Roger, 11. Press on. If you think it looks level by eyeball, go ahead.


LMP (EVA)
Okay.


CDR (EVA)
...


CDR (EVA)
There you go. Good work; good show. Hey, whoa; stop, stop! Back up.


LMP (EVA)
Houston, as I was spacing the PSE, the right hand solar array deployed automatically. The left hand I had to manually *** the bar at the far end.


LMP (EVA)
All parts of the solar array are clear of the ground now.

Buzz, this is Houston. I understand that you did successfully deploy both solar arrays. Over.


LMP (EVA)
Roger. That's affirmative. And there isn't any way of telling whether that's lined up. I'm getting in the way; maybe I can get down here.

Neil, this is Houston. Over.


CDR (EVA)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. We've been looking at your consumables, and you're in good shape. Subject to your concurrence, we'd like to extend the duration of the EVA 15 minutes from nominal. We will still give Buzz a hack at 10 minutes for heading in. Your current elapsed time is 2 plus 12. Over.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. That sounds fine.


CC
Roger. Out.

Buzz, this is Houston. If you're still in the vicinity of the PSE, could you get a photograph of the ball level? Over.


CDR (EVA)
I'll do that, Buzz.


LMP (EVA)
Right. We'll get a photograph of that. Houston, what time would you estimate we could allow for the documented sample? Over.


CDR (EVA)
Oh, shoot. Would you believe the ball is right in the middle now?


LMP (EVA)
Wonderful. Take a picture before it moves.

LMP (EVA)
Okay. Got that over with you, Neil?


CDR (EVA)
No, the closeup camera's underneath the MESA. I'll have to pick it up with the prong. I'm picking up several pieces of really vesicular rock out here, now.


LMP (EVA)
You didn't get anything in those environmental samples, did you?


CDR (EVA)
Not yet.







LMP (EVA)
Well, I don't think we'll have time.


CC
Roger, Neil and Buzz. Let's press on with getting the closeup camera magazine and closing out of the sample return container. We're running a little low on time.


LMP (EVA)
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Can you quickly stick this in my pocket, Neil, and I'll head on up the ladder?


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
I'll hold it. You open the packet up.

Did you get that solar wind rolled up there, Buzz?


LMP (EVA)
Right. That's it right there.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Think you can reach the - reach this hook that's hanging over here? You might entertain the idea of sending up the second one that way.

I will. Get that up now.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I'm heading on in.







CDR (EVA)
Okay.

About ready to send up the LEC?


CDR (EVA)
Yes. Just about.


LMP (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. That's got it clear.


CDR (EVA)
Oh. Uh - oh. The camera came off. I mean the film pack came off.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Just ease it down now. Don't pull so hard on it. All right, let it go.


CDR (EVA)
While you're getting that, I've got to get the camera.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. This - This one's in. No problem.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. Stand by a second.

CDR (EVA)
Okay. I've got one side hooked up to the second box and I've got the film pack on.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Good.







CDR (EVA)
Boy, that bilge from on the LEC is kind of falling all over me while I'm doing this.


LMP (EVA)
All that soot, huh?


CDR (EVA)
That's what it looks like down here.


LMP (EVA)
I think my watch stopped, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Did it?


LMP (EVA)
No, it didn't either. Second hand.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. If you can just kind of hold it, why, I think I can do the pulling.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. Stand by a minute. Let me move back.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Easy. All right, easy in the hatch now.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I'll get it the rest of the way. And I'll give it to you to - No, wait, just a second. Yes, a little more.

Roger, Tranquility. We'd like to hold off as long as possible on the lithium hydroxide canister. Make that one of the last things you do in getting ready for the DEPRESS, if you can. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. We're planning on doing that. I was just wondering how much longer we want to wait, though. We've probably got another half an hour's worth of picture taking, and I guess we could run through an eat cycle and then change the canister, and then DEPRESS. Over.

of those grid squares at a time. The area that we've been sweeping covers 10's and 20's and 30's of them.

CC
Roger. There's no problem fuel wise. It's just that there seems to be a limit to the number of P22's and the number of grid squares you can search over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Well, I'll continue this maneuver then to roll 82, pitch 218, yaw zero, if that's okay with you, and do a P52 in that attitude. And that'll be a sleep ...

Roger. When you get back into your surface checklist and come over to the COMM reconfiguration on page Surface 45, we'd like you to enable the ranging feature on your S band. That is, when you come down to S band configuration, instead of CAUTION and WARNING ELECTRONICS, ENABLE TV, we'd like you to go into the RANGE position and leave it there for as long as you conveniently can until you get ready to commence your rest period; and we'll try to get a little more ranging data on you. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Copy.


CC
And of course, when you get ready to turn in, go back into caution and warning, ENABLE, and we'd like to say from all of us down here in Houston and really from all of us in all the countries and in the entire world, we think that you've done a magnificent job up there today. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Thank you very much.


LMP (TRANQ)
It's been a long day.


CC
Yes, indeed. Get some rest there and have at it tomorrow.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility. Did you all come up with any other solution that we might try to the mission timer problem? Over.


CC
Stand by, Tranquility. We'll be back with you in just a minute.


LMP (TRANQ)
And, Houston, Tranquility. Have you had enough TV for today?


CC
Tranquility, this is Houston. Yes, indeed. It's been a mighty fine presentation there.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Signing off. See you again tomorrow.







CC
Roger.


CC
Columbia, Colunbia, this is Houston. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. Sorry to bother you, Columbia. Two things: we request that you select 10 degree deadband in your DAP in accordance with the procedures on Foxtrot 9 7 in your checklist; and secondly, we'd like to leave a display on the DSKY that is not one that's cycling, being continuously updated. What you have when you get through widening the deadband will be a static display, and that'll be satisfactory. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay.


CC
Roger. Goodnight again.


CC
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Go ahead.


CC
Roger. On your mission timer, we wanted to pull the circuit breaker and let it cool down for an hour and a half to 2 hours. I believe the breaker is currently open. It has been off, so go ahead and reset the mission timer circuit breaker. Put the timer control to RESET and hold it in RESET for 30 seconds, and then slew it to your desired settings left to right, and place the timer control to START. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. We'll try it.


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, our mission timer seems to be slewing okay. You want to give us a time hack? Or can we get it off the CMC   LGC, I mean?


CC
Roger, Tranquility. I'll give you a time hack at 114 31 00. It's about 30 seconds from now. Over.


CC
Stand by for a Mark at 114 31.







LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. ... you.


CC
Stand by.


CC
MARK.


CC
Tranquility, this is Houston. Did you copy my Mark at 114 31?


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Thank you, and our mission timer is running now.


CC
Roger. Very good. And, I've got a consumables update for you if you're ready to copy or listen. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Stand by.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Go ahead.


CC
Okay. RCS Alfa is 81 percent, RCS Bravo 75 percent. Coming up on 115 hours GET, descent oxygen is 31.8 pounds or 59 percent; descent amp hours 858, and ascent amp hours 574. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Copy. Thank you very much.


CC
Roger. Out.


CC
Tranquility, this is Houston. We also have a set of about 10 questions relating to observations you made, things you may have seen during the EVA. You can either discuss a little later on this evening or sometime later in the mission at your option. How do you feel? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
I guess we can take them up now.


CC
Okay. And your friendly Green Team here has pretty well been relieved by your friendly Maroon Team, and I'll put Owen on with the questions.


CC
Tranquility - -


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Go ahead.







CC
Tranquility, Houston. First question here is how your best estimate of the yaw on the - of the LM as compared to the nominal preflight plan. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
We got 13 degrees left on the ball, and I think that's probably about right. Looking at the shadow and so on, we prob - probably about 13 degrees left of the shadow.


CC
Roger. That's 13 degrees left of the shadow. And, next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near the first part of the EVA and any changes in composition that you might have observed during the bulk sampling interval. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
I'm not sure I understand that question, but we got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizable number of selected rock fragments of different types.


CC
Roger, Neil. One of the implications here is the depth from which the bulk sample was collected. Did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
We got some down from as much as 3 inches in the area where I was looking at variation with depth in the bulk sample. There really wasn't appreciable difference, and I didn't run into any hard bed. Later on, or at some other times and other areas, why, I'd get down just a short distance, an inch or two, and couldn't go any further.


CC
Roger. Believe we understand down as deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition to that depth. Next question, the - the second SRC was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation, and wonder if you would be able to provide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second SRC. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
We got two core tubes and solar wind and about half of the big sample bag full of assorted rocks which I picked up hurriedly from around the area. I tried to get as many representative types as I could.







CC
Roger, Neil. Next topic here relates to the rays which emanate from the DPS engine burning area. We're wondering if the rays emanating from the - beneath the engine are any darker or lighter than the surrounding surface. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
The ones that I saw back in the aft end of the spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker; of course, viewed from the aft end, why, they did have the Sun shining directly on them. It seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction, but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet, from the skirt of the engine. Over.


CC
Roger. Understand that near the aft end out to the east that the rays did appear darker. I understand, Buzz, that these were - this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending outward. Is that correct?


LMP (TRANQ)
No. I wouldn't say it was necessarily material that had been uncovered. I think some of the material might have been baked or in some way caused to be more cohesive and perhaps flow together in some way, I don't know. Now, in other areas, before we started trampling around out front, why, we could see that small erosion had taken place in a radially outward direction, but it had left no significant mark on the surface other than just having eroded it away. Now, it was different back in the - right under the skirt itself. It seems as though the surface had been baked in a streak fashion, and I think a couple of pictures on film will show this. But that didn't extend out very far. Over.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. And this baked appearance that you described, at least the suggestion is that it was due to the heat of the engine at any rate. Next subject, did - -


LMP (TRANQ)
I believe so.


CC
Roger. Next subject, did either of the solar panels on the PSE touch the surface of the Moon during deployment? Over.







LMP (TRANQ)
I think that two corners did touch, since when it was deployed, both of them didn't come out at the same time. It unfolded a little unevenly, and of course, the terrain that it was on was a little bit - not quite as level as it was - as I would like to have it. And I think that two corners did touch to about 1 inch - no, three quarters to a half an inch deep; and maybe along the bottom, it might have been maybe 3 inches, leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners; and I think these are on the western ones. Over.


CC
Roger. Understand the description there. And the next subject, on the two core tubes which you collected, how did the driving force required to collect these tubes compare? Was there any difference? Over


LMP (TRANQ)
Not significantly. I could get down to about the first 2 inches without much of a problem, and then as I would pound it in about as hard as I could do it, and the second one took two hands on the hammer, and I was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod, and it just wouldn't go much more than - I think the total depth might have been about 8 or 9 inches. But even there, it didn't - For some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. In other words, I'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't - just penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over, if that makes any sense at all. It didn't really to me. Over.


CC
Roger, Buzz. I think I've got the picture. You indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continue hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it in to a total depth of 8 or 9 inches, and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical, that they'd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far. Is that correct?


LMP (TRANQ)
Yes. That's about it. It wasn't a rapid change in resistive force. And also I noticed when I took the bit off that the material was quite well packed, a good bit darker, and it - The way it adhered to the core tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist. Over.







CC
Roger. Understand the general impression of being moist as it packed in the core tube. Next question: we did copy your comments prior to the EVA of your general description of the area. We wonder if either of you would have any more lengthy description or more detailed description of the general summary of the geology of the area. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Yes let's - we'll - We'll postpone our answer to that one until tomorrow. Okay?


CC
Yes, indeed. That'll be fine. Just a couple more here, and I think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there. Can you estimate the stroke of the primary and secondary struts? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Well, I could do it like this, Owen. About all the struts are about equally stroked, and the height from the ground to the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 and 1/2 feet, huh?


CC
Roger. Understand, Neil. Next topic, as - just after landing, you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plus Z axis from the LM. Are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar ray during the sunset - as sunset approaches in your locality - Are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the ray? Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
No. I don't believe so, I think that it's - It's about as level as any other areas that we chose.


CC
Roger. I - -


LMP (TRANQ)
There's nothing large, anyway, that's going to get in the way.


CC
Roger. Copy. That's also the way it appeared from the television, I think. And now the final question. You commented, Neil, that on your approach to the landing spot, you had passed over a football field sized crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size. Can you estimate the distance to this football sized crater from your present position? Over.







CDR (TRANQ)
I thought we'd be close enough so that when we got outside we could see its rim back there but I couldn't. But I don't think that we're more than a half mile beyond it. That is a half mile west of it.


CC
Roger. So you estimate your present position less than half a mile approximately west of this large crater. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
That's correct.


CC
Okay. Well, that takes care of the questions from our geologists for tonight, and unless you have something else, that'll be all for - from us for the evening. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Thank you.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We've now collected all the ranging data that we can use, and you can go back to caution and warning ENABLE. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Will do.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. Two more verifications, here. Can you - will you verify that the disk with messages was placed on the surface as planned, and also that the items listed in the flight plan - all of those listed there were jettisoned. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
That's - All that's verified.


CC
Roger. Thank you, and I hope this will be a final good night.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay.

Columbia, Columbia, good morning from Houston.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Hi, Ron.


CC
Hey, Mike, how's it going this morning?


CMP (COLUMBIA)
How goes it?


CC
Hey, real fine. While you're - -


CMP (COLUMBIA)
I don't know yet, how's it going with you?


CC
Real fine here. Columbia, request P00 and ACCEPT. We'll shove the state vector in for you right away.


CC
Okay. It's coming up now, Columbia. We're going to keep you a little busy here. As soon as we get the state vector in, we'd like you to go ahead and do a P52 option 3 on this night pass, and then when you come on around the other side there, we'll give you some landmark tracking information on prime 130.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay.


CC
And for your information, we're also going to have Tranquility Base do a P52 when you come around the other time; and I have the P22 information if you're ready to copy.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead.


CC
Okay. Track landmark 130 prime using P22, and for information, this will properly position your rendezvous radar transponder. T1 is 122 plus 16 plus 05 - whoops, okay. Stand by.


CC
Columbia, Houston. The computer is yours.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. And I'd like the grid square of this crater 130 prime. Over.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Say again about 130 prime.







CMP (COLUMBIA)
I'd like its grid square, please.


CC
Roger. Stand by.


CC
Columbia, Houston.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. I have the T1 and T2 times and also the longitude of the 130 prime. We're working on the grid squares and we'll get them shortly.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Ready to copy.


CC
Okay. T1: 122 plus 16 plus 05. Tango 2 is 122 plus 21 plus 11, and 6 miles north of track. And do you want your NOUN 89 values?


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes, please.


CC
Roger. Latitudes, plus 01.243. Longitude over 2, plus 11.844. Altitude, minus 001.46. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Copy T1: 122 16 05. T2: 122 21 11, 6 miles north, NOUN 89 is plus 01243, plus 11844, minus 00146.


CC
Columbia, affirmative. And at the T1 time, put your rendezvous radar transponder switch to OPERATE.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
All right.


CC
And this 130 prime is the same one that you tracked prior to descent. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. You've updated your information as to the LM's position and this is your best estimate of where the LM is, is that correct?


CC
Columbia, that's negative. This 130 is the little bitty crater there that you tracked - John Young's crater - that you tracked prior to descent. And we want that - -


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Fine. Okay. You've given up looking for that.







CC
Affirmative. We want this for one last fix on your plane.


 CMP (COLUMBIA)
All right. Fine. Understand. Thank you.


CC
And when the LM does his P22 on your transponder, well then, that'll be our last shot at the LM's position.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Understand. Do you care whether my transponder is on before T1?


CC
Roger. It'll be on WARMUP prior to that time, and you can go to OPERATE anywhere around that time.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes. I gather it's on its 24 minute warmup now?


CC
Roger.


CC
And, Houston. The computer is yours, you can go to BLOCK anytime.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. BLOCK, going P52, option 3.


CC
Roger. And we'll see you coming around the other side. About 1 minute to go, and all your systems are looking good.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Thanks, Ron.

Tranquility Base, Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Good morning, Houston. Tranquility Base. Over.


CC
Roger. Loud and clear. And how is the resting standing up there. Did you get a chance to curl up on the engine can?


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Neil has rigged himself a really good hammock with a waste tether, and he's been lying







on the ascent engine cover, and I curled up on the floor. Over.


CC
Roger. Copy, Buzz. Got a couple of changes to your surface checklist here, and in general, what we're going to want you to do is P22, tracking the command module for one last hack on your position there. And this will be - in other words, P57, P22, and then to press on with the checklist, and the rest of them are a couple of minor changes in the checklist. The main one being that we do not want the rendezvous radar on during the ascent, and we think that this will take care of some of the overflow of program alarms which we're getting during descent.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. We had the rendezvous radar in SLEW during descent, though.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. I missed that. Say again.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I say again. We had the rendezvous radar switch in the SLEW position, not the LGC position.


CC
Roger. We copy that. But there's a greater duty cycle on - There's a good 15 percent duty cycle on the ascent program there, so just go ahead and leave it off. And I have the changes there if you want to get out your surface checklist, and I can go ahead and start giving them to you.


CDR (TRANQ)
All right. Go ahead. I've got it out.


CC
Okay. Before we start here, request P00 and DATA, and we'll give you some vectors.


CDR (TRANQ)
Now you've got P00 and DATA.


CC
Okay. And on Surface 50 will be the first change there.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. And I understand you want us to do a P57 option 3 and then a P22, is that the general idea? Over.


CC
That's affirmative. So on Surface 50 there, down at the bottom of the page, just after PRO after two recycles, stick in a time of 122 plus 15; do P22 as per PGNS 20 of G&amp;N dictionary. Over.







CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Understand that's 122 15, do P22 as per PGNS 20, G&amp;N dictionary.


CC
Roger. Okay. Let's skip on over to Surface 59.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


CC
Okay. This is going to be for one last vent on the DPS tank there, so at the top of the page just after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add - Okay, after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add PROP DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT CLOSE, and then after STABILIZATION/CONTROL AELD, CLOSE, add PROP DISPLAYS/ENGINE 0VERRIDE/LOGIC, CLOSE. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Copy. These are two circuit breakers, right?


CC
Tranquility Base, affirmative. Those are just the circuit breakers at that time.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. Did you get those two on the propulsion circuit breakers?


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I have those two.


CC
Okay. Let's go over to Surface 60, and then down the middle of the page, after launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, then I add the switches there.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Go ahead then.


CC
Okay. After launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, add DESCENT PROPULSION FUEL VENT, OPEN; add DESCENT PROPULSION OXIDIZER VENT, OPEN; add verify talkback gray. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. DESCENT PROPELLANT FUEL VENT, OPEN; DESCENT PROPELLANT OXIDIZER VENT, OPEN; verify talkback gray.


CC
Roger. You got that one, so that'll be the last vent and it will continue venting. Skip over to Surface 61 down there at TIG minus 17.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I'm there. Go ahead.







CC
Okay, at TIG minus 17, delete CB (11). AC Bus A, RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE, wait 30 seconds; delete PGNS: RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE; and then add UP DATA LINK switch to VOICE BACKUP. Over


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I have that. We'll leave those two circuit breakers open, and have the UP DATA LINK to VOICE BACKUP; and we'll make the appropriate changes on the following circuit breaker status card.


CC
Roger. And then you might add a little note down there at the bottom of the page - Note: - This is at the bottom of page 61 - Note: Do not use tape meter in PGNS, i.e., do not place MODE SELECT switch to PGNS. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. We'll put it in AGS.


CC
Roger. Fair enough. That's some more of that computer load business.


CC
Okay. That's all the changes we have for the checklist here. I've got some - just some general notes, I'll read to you on P22, and just for some information. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Then it looks to me like we ought to get hopping on this P57.


CC
Roger. We agree wholeheartedly. And while you're starting on that, I'll read - just read these notes on P22. Call P22 possible program alarm 5.6, range greater than 400 nautical miles, and then use the P22 as described on PGNS 20. Take option 1 in NOUN 06, and use the no update mode. The rendezvous radar will lock on at about 25 degrees elevation above the horizon. If 503 alarm occurs, designate fail. Key a PROCEED and allow the rendezvous radar to search for the CSM. And place the range altitude monitor switch in altitude/altitude rate to prevent the tape meter from driving into the stops. And press on.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I think I have that.

Tranquility, Houston. Roger.


CDR (TRANQ)
On second thought, since that will peg the range rate, I guess maybe we'd better not do that. And







for this range that the AGS are showing now, 425 miles with a signal strength of 2.2. It looks like we ought to proceed on this. Over.


CC
Roger. Stand by one. Tranquility, affirmative. Proceed.

Are you getting the information on the downlink now?


CC
Tranquility, affirmative, and we're saving it. We've got 4 so far, and it's looking good.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. What do you people think about calling up a VERB 83?


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Stand by on that now. We're getting the data now. We're checking on the VERB 83.

We just lost lock.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Go.

Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy. Thank you.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
BATT bus B is 37. BATT bus A is 36, or I'd think the gauge is stuck.


CC
Roger. And you're looking good to us - to us, Columbia.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes sir. Keep it that way.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Columbia is coming up on a VERB 45 ENTER to reset the surface flag.

CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. We have four out of eight circuit breaker talkbacks indicating red. We still have the circuit breakers out as of right now. I believe at this moment we have just entered VERB 77 on tape 3052 and are ready to proceed with the hot fire. Is it normal to have these four red flags? Over.

CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility. I used Capella in the last sighting, and it's a good ways near the edge. A good ways away from the center of detent 4. I'm wondering if it would pay any to use Alpheratz, star number 1. It might be a little closer. However, it would delay things a little, since I'd have to designate the radar out of the way. Over.

Glad to have all you big room full of people looking over our shoulder.


CDR (TRANQ)
We had a lot of help down there, Jim.







CDR (TRANQ)
And, Houston, Tranquility Base is going to give you a few comments with regard to the geology question of last night. We are landed in a relatively smooth crater field of elongate secondary - circular secondary craters, most of which have rims irrespective of their - raised rims irrespective of their size. That's'not universally true. There are - There are a few of the smaller craters around which do not have a discernable rim. The ground mass throughout the area is a very fine sand to a silt. I'd say the thing that would be most like it on Earth is powdered graphite. Immersed in this ground mass are a wide variety of rock shapes, sizes, textures, rounded and angular, many with varying consistencies. As I said, I've seen plain - what looked to be plain basalt and vesicular basalt. Others with no crystals, some with small white phenocrysts, maybe one to less than 5 percent. And the bould - we are in a boulder field where the boulders range generally up to 2 feet with a few larger than that. Now, some of the boulders are lying on top of the surface, some are partially exposed, and some are just barely exposed. And in our traverse around on the surface and particularly working with the scoop, we've run into boulders below the surface - it was probably buried under several inches of the ground mass.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Roger. Very fine description.


CDR (TRANQ)
I suspect this boulder field may have some of its origin with this large sharp edged rocky rim crater that we passed over at final descent. Now yesterday I said that was about the size of a football field, and I have to admit it was a little - little hard to measure coming in. But I thought that it might just fit in the Astrodome as we came by it. And the rocks in the vicinity of the - of this rocky rim crater are much larger than these in this area. Some are 10 feet or so and perhaps bigger, and they are very thickly populated out to about one crater diameter beyond the crater rim. Beyond that, there is some diminishing, and even out in this area the blocks seem to run out in rows with irregular patterns, and then there are paths between them where there are considerably less surface evidence of hard rocks. Over.







CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We copy. Thank you very much.


CC
And, Tranquility Base, we're through with the ranging. You can take your S band function switch to OFF RESET.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger.


CC
And, Tranquility, I have a LM consumables update for you.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Ready to copy.


CC
Okay. At 123 plus 00, RCS Alfa 78 - 78 percent PQMD, Bravo is 76 percent PQMD, descent O2 is 62 percent - 62 percent. Descent ampere hours are 590, 590 remaining, ascent ampere hours are 574, 574 remaining. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Copy. Sounds very good. Thank you.


CC
Roger.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston.


CDR (TRANQ)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. For your P57 ..., we did a little looking around, and it looks like Sirius and Rigel out at detent 6 would be real good on that. The Sun angle on Sirius is about 43 degrees, and on Rigel, it's about 55 degrees. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger, Houston. The only trouble is that the Sun is in number 5, the closed one. And it appears to also be close enough to detent 6 to shine on the far side of the cone. And it completely obscures detent 6. I'm - unable to use that at all.


CC
Okay. We understand it now, and thank you.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. For your information, the circuitry looks real fine on that ascent engine arm circuit breaker.







LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. I don't think I could get it out now if I wanted to.


CC
Roger. We copy.


LMP (TRANQ)
And it looks like in detent 6 I can pick up Venus right at the fringe, but I can't get anything else.


CC
Roger.


CDR (TRANQ)
And by the way, Houston, our EVA antenna did retract.


CC
Roger. Mighty fine. Thank you.


CC
Tranquility, Houston.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Go ahead.


CC
Roger. It looks like you're going to have to reposition the radar here. We suggest you may want to start your TIG minus 45 minute - that point in the checklist at about TIG minus 50. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Why do you think I need to move the radar?


CC
Well, we thought that you probably wouldn't be able to get the star there.


LMP (TRANQ)
On the rear detent, the radar can be pointing plus X, and I'm - I'll be using right rear. That's okay.


CC
Roger. That's fine then.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. I have one more late checklist change there on the rendezvous radar position for lift off. Over. From page Surface 57.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Go ahead.


CC
Okay. On Surface 57 there on your VERB 21 NOUN 73 trunnion, leave it 180; the shaft we'd like 335. Over.







LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Understand. Shaft 335.


CC
Roger. And if the steerable doesn't quite hack it on lift off, looks like the forward OMNI is good for about 30 to 60 seconds after lift off. And then the aft OMNI antenna is good for the rest of the ascent. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Copy.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, we've got two angles here at 3 minutes in ascent. Would you confirm those? Pitch 134 and yaw minus 32. Over.


CC
Tranquility Base. Roger. We verify; those are correct.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston.


CDR (TRANQ)
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. Eagle's looking real fine to us down here. We have a fairly high confidence that we know the position of the LM. However, it is possible that we may have a planes change, but the - In the worst case, it would be up to 30 feet per second. And, of course, we don't expect that at all.


BEGIN LUNAR REV 25


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility Base. Since we've still got plenty of time I think I'll go ahead and recycle on this 604.


CC
Tranquility. Roger. That's okay with us, and we assume that the primary canister is still aboard. Is this correct?


LMP (TRANQ)
We have one primary canister on board and one secondary. The other primary is - out in front of the Z - plus - Z pad. Over.


CC
Roger. We copy. Thank you.

CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility. We're not sure that we got number 2 tank to fire. It's still showing a high pressure.


CC
Roger. We confirm that. Try it again.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. We'll go to number 2 this time.


CC
Roger. we concur.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. No problem.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, looks like there's very little difference between the two.


CC
Roger.


LMP (TRANQ)
We've got number 2 reading 3050 and number 1 is reading - 3000 and it drops down to 2990.







So I'm not sure that it's really indicative that it didn't go. Over.


CC
Roger. We copy and we agree.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. I assume we're - we're GO for lift off, and we'll proceed with the ascent feed.


CC
Roger. That's correct, and we'll go ahead and watch tank 2. If it doesn't - tank 2 doesn't decrease, we'll tell you to close the ascent feeds and open the shutoffs. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Ascent feeds are open and shutoffs are closed.

That's affirmative. I called you before about the VHF ranging. It's not working. ***


LMP (EAGLE)
Houston, Eagle. Did you copy our star angle difference and torquing angles.


CC
Eagle, Houston. We didn't have them on the downlink but we copied them on the VOX.


LMP (EAGLE)
Okay. It was zero for star angle difference, minus 06, plus 64, and plus 1.37. Over.


CC
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We have that.


LMP (EAGLE)
That's it. Got a good lockon, Houston.


LMP (EAGLE)

Your really think its apogee is 125 21, huh? 25 ... That circuit breaker is in.


LMP (EAGLE)
Engine arm circuit breaker.

Roger, Columbia. Loud and clear now. This is Houston.







CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Would you tell Eagle his Y dot is minus 1.0. Over.


CC
Roger. Eagle, Columbia says your Y dot is minus 1.0. Over.


CDR (EAGLE)
Roger, Houston. We got that. Thank you.


CC
Roger. And you can go high bit rate now. Eagle can.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Eagle, Columbia. How do you read?


LMP (EAGLE)
AGS agrees very closely, and pointing ...


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia is unable to read Eagle on either antenna or on VHF duplex Bravo. You got any suggestions?


CC
Roger. Columbia, we understand. You are unable to read Eagle. Stand by.


CDR (EAGLE)
Houston, tell Columbia that we read him about strength 2.


LMP (EAGLE)
Okay. Wide deadband on.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. Also my VHF ranging is not working now, and I'd like to know whether you'd like me to continue making sextant marks or do nothing. I'm supposed to be doing VHF marks only, and it's for the next 6 or 7 minutes.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy. And, Eagle, looks like the best antenna would be forward for the LM. And, break. Eagle, we missed your loading of the TPI TIG and P32. Could you confirm you've done that?


CC
Columbia, Houston. Recommend you take sextant marks and do not reinitialize. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger, Houston. Columbia's got the VHF ranging back now. I'll stick with the nominal. Thank you.







CC
Roger. Mighty fine.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Columbia reading you loud and clear now, Eagle.


CC
Columbia, Houston.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. Mike, you can go ahead and get as many VHF and sextant marks as you can here in this period of time.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. I've just got time for maybe two sextant marks, then get on with the final count.


CC
Eagle and Columbia, about 1 minute till LOS there on Columbia. It looks like we have about 51.5 for CSI, and we tend to confirm your Y dot. And, break. For Eagle, verify VHF Bravo transmitter is off.


LMP (EAGLE)
Roger. VHF Bravo is off.


CC
Eagle, Houston. Recommend aft OMNI and are you GO for CSI, so we can let Columbia know. Over.


LMP (EAGLE)
Roger. We're GO for CSI.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Did you copy? Eagle is GO for CSI.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
No, I did not copy. I'm reading them only intermittently, but thank you.

CC
Eagle, Houston. Stand by. We'll check it. And, Eagle, Houston. Can you give us a burn report?







LMP (EAGLE)
Roger. Stand by.


LMP (EAGLE)
Okay. The CSI burn was on scheduled time of 125 19 3470, 51.5 feet per second was our solution. After chasing residuals a little bit, we ended up with a minus 0.2, plus 0.7, and minus 0.1. And in the AGS, at that time, we had plus 0.4, plus 0.9, and plus 0.3.


CC
Eagle - Eagle, Houston. We copy. Any plane change? Over.

Okay.


CMP
I'm pumping up cabin pressure.







CMP
That was a funny one. You know, I didn't feel it shock, and I thought things were pretty steady. I went to RETRACT there, and that's when all hell broke loose. Were you guys - did it appear to you to be - that you were jerking around quite a bit during the retrack cycle?


CDR
Yes. It seemed to happen at the time I put the plus X thrust to it, and apparently it wasn't centered, because somehow or other I accidentally got off in attitude and then the attitude hold system started firing.

Yes. I was sure busy there for a couple of seconds.


CMP
Are you hearing me all right? I got a horrible squeal.


CDR
Yes. I agree with that, but we hear you okay. Over.

CMP
Roger. I'm supposed to adjust the oxygen flow in this thing to six tenths of a pound per hour, but being as how this transducer is not working right, could you give me an updated number?

Boy, you were really waiting for that one, weren't you? Okay, Ron. Thank you.


CMP
Houston, I did that, and I believe we are flowing oxygen, but the gage is just pegged FULL SCALE LOW.

LMP
Okay. Any particular attitude you would like the PGNS in when we do that?


LMP
No. We're not getting any. Could you give us some course align gimbal angles to move the PGNS to, and then we will align the AGS to the PGNS. Over.


CC
Roger. Eagle. We concur. Stand by on the gimbal angles. And also, Eagle, while we've got the command module direct O2 on there, there's a possibility that your cabin relief might relieve if we get up around cabin pressure of about 5.4 or 5.5.


LMP

Okay. We are pretty close to 000. Is that all right?


CC
Eagle, that's beautiful.


LMP
Now, you might want to take into account what will happen when the CSM maneuvers to jettison attitude.







CC
Eagle, Houston. We don't care what - All we are trying to do is get a drift rate and see how long it takes them to drift apart on the thing after you jettison.


LMP
Okay. Will we be jettisoning at about this attitude? That's okay. I'll align the AGS with the PGNS. You can tell me a little later if you need some help.


CC
Eagle, Houston. That's fine.


CMP
Houston, Columbia. You want me to roll over and get high gain or anything like that?

CDR
Okay.


CMP
You say you wanted the probe now?


CC
Eagle, Houston.


CDR
Houston, Eagle. Go ahead.


CC
Roger. That ACA out of detent didn't quite do it because the mode control switches were off. Request guidance control to PGNS and then back to AGS, and that will zero the AGS, there. Over.


CDR
Say again, please.


CC
Roger. Request guidance control switch to PGNS and then back to AGS. Over.


CDR
Okay. We still have both mode control switches off. Over.


CC
That's okay. That's good.

Eagle, Houston. That's fine.


CC
Columbia and Eagle, Houston. About 5 minutes to LOS. Your LM jet time will be 131 plus 52, and I have the rest of the maneuver PAD if you want it now, or I can give it to you on the next time around.

Columbia, Houston. It looks like you guys are so speedy on us that we're thinking about moving up jettison time to about a GET of 130 plus 30, if that's okay with you all. Over.


CMP
That's fine. I've still got to get a P30 PAD from you.


CC
Roger. We want to talk to you about that. Mike, we can - for your druthers, we can do it either way. We can either let you do it in the jettison in P30 - correction P47, or we can send you a P30 target load up and then you - let you call P41, whichever you want to do. Over.


CMP
Yes, I see. Ron was going to give me a P30 PAD and the flight plan says P47. Out of the two, I prefer to go to P30, P41 route.


CC
Roger. Beautiful. We've got the load. If you'll give us P00 and ACCEPT, we'll send you a load up. Stand by.


CC
Columbia, Houston. We'd like you to terminate direct O2 flow, and stand by on your P00 and ACCEPT. We'll have to generate a new load due to the moveup on time. Over.


CMP
Roger.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Over.


CMP
Go ahead.


CC
Roger, Mike. It looks like if we move up this jettison time and give you a new load, it would require a new attitude, and we can't do that due to the LM already closed out, and it would fight us all the way around and we'd lose COMM with it. We're thinking separating in P47 in about 10 minutes. We're looking at trajectories and we'll be right with you momentarily. Over.


CMP
Okay. It's no big thing with me either way.


CC
Roger.


CC
Hello, Columbia. Houston. We'd like you to start down your jettison checklist. We recommend


CC
Columbia, Houston. Don't try to chase it, just hold what you've got.


LMP
Charlie, did it hold cabin pressure this time?


CC
Say again, Buzz. Over.


LMP
Okay. I thrusted back - I thrusted back toward it a little bit, Charlie, and I'm now reading NOUN 83, plus four balls 4, minus four balls 8, and you want me to kill average D. Right?


CC
Stand by. That's affirmative. You can exit P47.


CDR
There she goes. It was a good one.


CC
Roger dodger. We got Eagle looking good. It's holding cabin pressure and it picked up about 2 feet per second from that jettison.


LMP
I believe that. I can see some cracks on the outer coating around the tunnel. In the thermal protective covering, I don't think it has anything to do with the structure.


CC
Roger.


CC
Hello, Columbia, Houston. We'll have an attitude and a little blip burn for you in about 130 30, so we can separate from Eagle. Over.


CMP
That's fine.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Would you start a maneuver to a pitch of 230 for this little tweak burn? Over.


CMP
Roger. Pitch 230.


CC
Roger, Mike. And verify track mode in AUTO for the high gain.


CMP
We're in REACQ. Is that all right?


CC
Say again. We need AUTO.


CMP
Say again. We're in REACQ - AUTO REACQ.


CC
Roger. We need AUTO, please, sir.


CMP
Okay. You got it.







CMP
Roll zero, pitch 320, yaw zero?


CC
Right now that's what we're looking at. Stand by. We might have you roll so we can keep the high gain. Stand by.


CMP
Roger.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Over.


CMP
Go ahead.


CC
Roger, Mike - -


CDR
Apollo 11, these days.


CC
Oh, Roger, Apollo 11. We got you going to a posigrade attitude and we want you - this burn will be using minus X thrusters at about 2 or 3 feet per second, and we got a load for you. We'll send it up momentarily. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us P00 and ACCEPT? We have a load for you. Over.


CMP
You got it.


CC
Roger, Mike. And our pitch attitude's a little wrong here. If you're ready to copy, I'll give you the SEP PAD. Over.


CMP
Go ahead. Ready to copy.


CC
Roger. Starting with NOUN 33: 130 30 0000, plus 00020, plus all zeros, plus all zeros. Roll all zeros, pitch 230, yaw zero. NOUN 44 is NA. DELTA-VP 00020, burn time 007, DELTA-VC 00020. We have - The rest of the PAD is NA.


CMP
Roger. GET 130 hours 30 minutes, DELTA-VX 2.0, roll zero, pitch 230, yaw zero, DELTA-VC, 2.0.


CC
That's affirmative, Apollo 11. And, Mike, it's similar to the SEP burn prior to flight after the undocking here. And the P41 you should see on register 1 - 2, and then you burn minus X until you read 4. Over.







CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Computer's yours. Over.


CMP
Roger, Charlie. We switched our OMNI D - Delta, and I lost that last transmission. Would you say again, please? The thing I'm wondering about specifically is that earlier you said it would be minus X thrusters and the PAD indicates plus X. Do you want me to null that to zero or do you want to add 2 and leave it as a 4?


CC
Roger, Apollo 11. The way we gave it to you in the attitude we're in, it'll be just like the SEP burn that you had yesterday. You'll see - NOUN 85 will give you a plus 2 and then you just burn minus X until you read 4. Over.


CMP
Understand.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We see you in P41 now. It might take you a couple of minutes to integrate these vectors that we gave you and if you don't make TIG, it's pretty insensitive. You can just let P41 bring you up to TIG, and when you get to zero, you can burn on that. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Okay. Burn complete. Residuals: plus three balls 40, plus four balls 7, plus four balls 2, DELTA-V counter 102.1. Over.


CC
Copy, Apollo 11. Looks good to us. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. How about coming up with a good communications attitude for us to go to between now and the time we maneuver at TEI attitude.


CC
Roger, sir. Stand by.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. A couple of things for you. Over.


CMP
Go ahead.


CC
Okay. Mike, you can maneuver to your preliminary TEI attitude as shown on page 398 of the flight plan, and the high gain angles are good as shown in the flight plan, and we'd like you to dump the waste water at 131 05 down to 10 percent. Over.







CMP
Okay. Understand. I'm going to go to roll 1.1, pitch zero - or 52.6, and yaw 13.8, and you want a waste water dump 10 percent starting at 131 05.


CC
That's affirmative. Right out the LOS.


CMP
Maneuver is in progress, Houston.


CC
Copy, 11. Out.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.


CMP
Apollo 11 under high gain. How do you read?


CC
Five by, 11. How me? Over.


CMP
You're loud and clear, Charlie. What - What numbers are you looking at for TEI TIG preliminary; 135 hours 23 minutes, something like that?


CC
That's affirmative, Mike. We're looking at about nominal time. We've considered kicking it up a REV, but we don't think this REV track is going to be any good since we had the RCS burn and we need some more tracking to get you a good TEI. Over.


CMP
That's what we're looking for.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. Looks like it's going to be pretty relaxed time here for the next couple of hours. We'll have you a PAD, of course, the next REV or so, and we'll keep you posted on TEI. Looks like nominal time. Over.


CMP
Thank you, Charlie.


CC
And your little maneuver back here a moment ago will put you about 20 miles ahead of the LM at TEI.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Imagine that place has cleared out a little bit after that rendezvous. You can find a place to sit down almost, huh?


CC
Roger. Our MOCR's about empty right now. We're taking it a little easy. How does it feel up there to have some company?







CMP
Damn good, I'll tell you.


CC
I'll bet. I bet, you'd almost be talking to yourself up there after 10 REVS or so.


CMP
No, no. It's a happy home here. It'd be nice to have company. As a matter of fact, it'd be nice to have a couple of hundred million Americans up here.


CC
Roger. Well, they were with you in spirit.


CMP
Let them see what they're getting for their money.


CC
Roger. Well, they were with you in spirit anyway, at least that many. We heard on the news today, 11, that last night - yesterday after you made your landing, New York Times came out with a - headlines, the largest headlines they've ever used in the history of the newspaper.


CMP
Save us a copy.


CDR
I'm glad to hear it was fit to print.


CC
It was great.


CC
That's why we didn't read you up any newscast. There really wasn't anything to talk about.


CMP
Hello, there, Boss.

Apollo 11, Houston. We've got 10 minutes to LOS; see you over the hill at 131 48. Over.


CMP
Okay, Charlie. I'll dump the water as soon as we go around the corner.

Roger. Everything's looking real good now.


CMP
Yes. Same here.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Coming up about 4 30 LOS. You're looking great on all your systems. Eagle is purring right along after an hour 30 without any cooling. The PNGS is still looking good. Over.


CMP
Roger.

Apollo 11, Houston. Will you verify that your rendezvous radar transponder is off? Over.




(GODS NET 1) Tape 84/8 Page 497


CMP
It's not, but I'll get it off.


CC
Roger. We were seeing - believe it or not, we were seeing some funnies on the Eagle's rendezvous radar, and that was the only theory that we had. It looked like it was a good one.


CMP
Good theory.

CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We are standing by. Everything is looking great here. Over.


LMP
Apollo 11. Roger.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you guys want it, we've got some news, here, we can read up. Over.


CDR
Be pleased to have it.


CC
Roger, Neil. Starting off: Congratulatory messages on the Apollo 11 mission have been pouring into the White House from world leaders in a steady stream all day. Among the latest are telegrams from Prime Minister Harold Wilson of Great Britain and the King of Belgium. The world's press has been dominated by news of Apollo 11. Some newsmen estimate that more than 60 percent of the news used in papers across the country today concerned your mission. The New York Times which, as we mentioned before, has had such a demand for its edition of the paper today (even though it ran 950 000 copies) said it will reprint the whole thing on Thursday as a souvenir edition. And Premier Alexei Kosygin has sent congratulations to you and President Nixon through former Vice President Humphrey who is visiting Russia. The cosmonauts have also issued a statement of congratulations. Humphrey quoted Kosygin as saying "I want you to tell the President and the American people that the Soviet Union desires to work with the United States in the cause of peace."


CC
And Mrs. Robert Goddard said today that her husband would have been so happy. "He wouldn't have shouted or anything. He would just have glowed." She added, "That was his dream, sending a rocket to the Moon." People around the world had many reasons to be happy about the Apollo 11 mission. The Italian police reported that Sunday night was the most crime free night of the year. And in London, a boy who had the faith to bet $5 with a bookie that a man would reach the Moon before 1970 collected $24.000. That's pretty good odds.







CC
You're probably interested in the comments your wives have made. Neil, Jan had said about yesterday's activities, "The evening was unbelievably perfect. It is an honor and a privilege to share with my husband, the crew, the Manned Spacecraft Center, the American public, and all mankind; the magnificent experience of the beginning of lunar exploration." She was then asked if she considered the Moon landing the greatest moment in her life. She said "No, that was the day we were married." And Mike, Pat said simply, "It was fantastically marvelous." Buzz, Joan said - apparently couldn't quite believe the EVA on the Moon. She said, "It was hard to think it was real until the men actually moved. After the Moon touchdown, I wept because I was so happy." But she added, "The best part of the mission will be the splashdown."


CC
In other news, and there was a little bit, another explorer: Thor Heyerdahl had to give up his attempt to sail a papyrus boat across the Atlantic. The storm damaged boat was abandoned about 650 miles from Bermuda. The speed of the craft had been reduced to about 25 miles a day, and Heyerdahl said the object of the voyage had not been to provide an endurance test for the crew.


CC
Looking at the world of sports, let's see here. While you were busy the other day, Joe Namath and football Commissioner Pete Rozelle made the announcement that "Broadway Joe" had agreed to sell his interest in the Bachelors III restaurant and report to the New York Jets. Joe arrived at the Jets' training camp today and had his first workout. Several other Jet players who had held out along with Joe also reported. And Davy Hill, from Jackson, Michigan, won his third major golf in as many starts in the past week. He won the Philadelphia Classic. Hill has won four tournaments so far this year and is the leading money winner this year with a cool $129.000. And in baseball, the west division of the National League remains a tight race. LA and San Francisco are one game behind league leading Atlanta. The Astros have a record of 48 wins and 48 losses, and are now in fifth place, seven games out. A twin bill between the Astros and Cincinnati last night was postponed because of rain. The Chicago Cubs







are still in first place in the East Division. They lead the New York Mets by four and one half games. And in the American League, Baltimore is breezing toward the Eastern Division title. They lead second place Boston by 11 games. Looking ahead, the All Star baseball game is scheduled for tomorrow. And President Nixon was scheduled to see the game and then leave immediately after the game for the Pacific splashdown area before going on his tour of Europe. And that about covers the news this day. You guys have been making most of it and I'm sure we couldn't fill you in on any of the details that you don't already know. Out.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I wondered if during the TEI burn you utilized the oxidizer flow valve on the PUGS. Over.


LMP
Yes, we did. Based on your very excellent briefing I was expecting the thing to continue desiring increase for the whole time, so we started out with it in INCREASE. I saw that we pretty quickly crossed the line and started falling about 6 or 7 percent behind, so I was still expecting it to move up, and then I went down to FULL DECREASE and brought it back down to a difference of 2 percent.

CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, did you notice any transients at ignition on TEI? Over.


CMP
Yes. The transients were more noticeable than on the previous burns, Charlie. I just wrote it off on the fact we had a light command module, but there was considerable roll activity which dampened down after the first 20 seconds, I would guess, of the burn; but then there was also some pitch and yaw activity. I don't believe it was abnormal, and it seemed to be deadbanding ratherly crisply in roll plus or minus about 8 degrees either side of the center line; and after the







first couple of - oh, after the first 20 seconds or so, the gimbals were quiet, and pitch and yaw were relatively quiet. Before that, there was some oscillation but mostly just in rates. Total attitude hung in there pretty well.

I think it's about time you powered down and got a little rest, however. You've had a mighty long day here. Hope you're all going to get a good sleep on the way back. I look forward to seeing you when you get back here. Don't fraternize with any of those bugs in route except for the Hornet.


CDR
Okay. Thank you, boss. We'll - We're looking forward to a little rest and a restful trip back. And see you when we get there.







CC
Roger. You've earned it.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to turn off O2 tank number 1 heaters. Over.


CMP
It's off. Thank you.


CC
Roger.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. For your information, the LGC in Eagle just went belly up at 7 hours. Over.


CDR
Okay. Very good, ... death of a real winner, there.


CMP
Charlie, we're going to rotate about pitch 270 degrees on the way home vice 1 - or 090 on the way out. Right?


CC
Right, sir.


CMP
Okay. VERB 49 maneuver to that attitude is in progress.


CC
Roger.


CDR
Houston, crew status report. Radiation: CDR 11017, CMP 10019,LMP 09020. No medication.


CC
Say again, please, Neil. We - you were breaking up. We missed that. Over.


CDR
Okay. This is crew status report. Radiation: CDR 11017, CMP 10019, LMP 09020. No medication.


CC
Roger. Thank you.


CC
And we didn't get any crew status report from you this morning. Wondered if you could give us an estimate of sleep last night. Over.


CDR
Okay ...


CDR
Okay. We'll take a guess, Charlie, and try to give an equivalent amount. Oh, it's CDR 3, and LMP 4.


CC
Roger. Thank you very much.







CDR
And, Charlie, you want the fans cycled ... Right?


CC
That's affirmative, and we'd like you to disable quads Charlie and Delta. Over.


CMP
Okay. Charlie and Delta.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. If it's convenient, we'd like to go through your onboard readout. Over.


CMP
Of what?


CC
Oh, excuse me. It's on the flight plan, 3102. We'd like BATTS and RCS. Over.


CMP
Stand by.


CMP
Ready to copy, Houston?

Apollo 11, Houston. A couple of questions for the Moon walkers, if you got a second. Over.


CDR
Go ahead.


CC
Roger, Neil. We're seeing some temperature rises on the passive seismic experiment that are a little higher than normal and were wondering if you could verify the deployed position. We understand it's about 40 feet from the LM in the eleven o'clock position. Over.


CDR
No. It's about in the nine or nine thirty position, and I'd say it's about 50 or 60 feet.


CC
Roger. Copy. Also, did you notice - was there any indication of any dust cloud as you lifted off? Over.







CDR
Not very much. There was quite a bit of Kapton and parts of the LM that went out in all directions, usually for great distances, as far as I can tell. But I don't remember seeing anything of a dust cloud to speak of.


CC
Roger. Understand all you could see was parts of the LM going out. What was your - your first - first comment? Over.


CDR
I don't remember. Just that the Kapton and other parts on the LM staging scattering all around the area for great distances, but I didn't see much dust.


CC
Roger. Thank you very much.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you keep me honest on the lithium hydroxide changes? When do you have the next one scheduled for?


CC
Stand by.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Mike, on that canister, we had you due to change one at 133 before TEI, and it's on page 399. The next one we got is at 147. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to extend our damping period for another 5 minutes; let the rates get way down. Over.


CMP
11. Roger.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Go ahead, 11. Over.


CMP
Roger, Charlie. Like to bring you up to date on our chlorination status. In compartment B4, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven - correction, we have eight pockets for chlorine and buffer ampules, of which - Let me correct that. We have seven pockets, of which one is empty and always has been empty, leaving six remaining. On the other side over there in B7, we have another container with seven pockets, so we have a total of seven plus six, and those are filled with six chlorines and seven buffers. Now, I've been using one chlorine and one buffer per day which, at this point in time, prior to







this chlorination I'm about to do, leaves me one chlorine and two buffers. Seems to me I'm one chlorine short, and that being the case, I'd like to ask your advice on postponing this chlorination using the last container until some later date, like maybe tomorrow. Over.


CC
Roger. We copy, Mike. Stand by.


CMP
Okay.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Check in A1, Mike, and see what you can find in there. Over.


CC
We think you might have some more chlorine up in A1. Over.

Good afternoon, Houston. Apollo 11. Over.


CC
Good morning, 11. This is Houston. Over.


CMP
Okay. Crew status report: 88 and 8.5.


CC
Roger. 88 and 8.5. When you're ready, we've got a small flight plan update for you.


LMP
Houston, we're ready to copy.


CC
Roger. At about 148 hours, if you've not already done so, a CO2 filter change, and the H2 purge line heater on 20 minutes before the O2 and H2 purge. At 148 hours, we'd like you to initiate a charge on battery Alfa instead of at 151 hours, and leave the charge on until we notify you further. At 150 hours GET, waste water dump to 10 percent. We do plan to burn midcourse correction 5. It will be an RCS burn about 5 feet per second at about the nominal time in the flight plan. Over.


LMP
Roger. Understand. We'll be accomplishing the filter change shortly, the purge line heater is on ***, O2 and H2 purge shortly, and at 148 will initiate a charge on battery A until you notify us further. At 150 hours, waste water dump to 10 percent. And we're looking forward to midcourse correction 5 at about 5 feet per second at the nominal time. Over.


CC
Roger. I've got your consumables update, if you're ready to copy.


LMP
Copy.


CC
Okay. At GET of 147 plus 00, RCS total minus 2.0 percent, which is about minus 14 pounds. Alfa minus 12.0, Bravo plus 10.0, minus 3.0, minus 2.0. Hydrogen total minus 1.5 pounds, O2 total plus 20 pounds. Over.


LMP
Roger. I copy, and our onboard readouts: Alfa, *** 2 percent, Bravo 54 percent, Cocoa's 64 percent, Delta 61 percent. Over.

CDR
Those guys down there in the press room did a pretty good job this morning.

LMP
Okay. We're all listening.


CC
Say again, 11?


LMP
Roger. We're all listening. Go ahead.


CC
Roger. From the hot wires of the Public Affairs Office: Apollo 11 still dominates the news around the world. Only four nations, Communist China, North Korea, North Viet Nam, and Albania, have not yet informed their citizens of your flight and landing on the Moon. One newsman said that he has run out of ways to describe your success. Tonight, President Nixon is scheduled to watch the All Star baseball game in Washington. After the game, he will depart for the Pacific recovery area. Wednesday evening, he will fly from Johnston Island by helicopter to the Navy communications ship Arlington. Then on Thursday morning, he will reboard the helicopter and fly to the Hornet in time to witness your splashdown. Accompanying the President will be Secretary of State William Rogers and Frank Borman. They will watch the splashdown from the bridge of the recovery ship with Admiral John Sidney McCain, Jr., Commander of the Pacific Forces. Following the President's stay aboard the Hornet, he will depart for his tour of Asia and scheduled visit to Romania. Luna 15 is believed to have crashed into the Sea of Crises yesterday after orbiting the Moon 52 times. The Soviet News Agency TASS reported that "scientific"







"research in near Moon space was carried out." Sir Bernard Lovell at Jodrell Bank Observatory said that Luna 15 hit the surface of the Moon at a speed of about 300 miles per hour. Things have been relatively quiet recently in Viet Nam. GI's on patrol were observed carrying transistor radios tuned into your flight. The Armed Forces radio and TV network in Viet Nam gave the mission full coverage. Skirmishes still continue between the Egyptians and Israelis along the Suez Canal. U.N. observers there are trying to halt the action. In Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee has voted to reduce the 27.5 percent oil depletion allowance to 20 percent. We've had rain several times here in the Houston area. Today it is cloudy, and more showers are expected. On the sports front, as we mentioned earlier, the All Star game is tonight. There were no games played yesterday. Last night in New York, the Baseball Writers Association of America named Babe Ruth the greatest ball player of all time. Joe DiMaggio was named the greatest living ball player. Frank Borman made the announcements at a dinner honoring the players. Joe Namath put in a full day at the New York Jets' training camp. Five policemen had a hard time restraining about 500 kids who wanted to touch Broadway Joe. He said he feels fine and will play in the All Star game August 1, if Coach Weeb Eubank lets him. The Oilers' camp at Kerrville got wet yesterday, but the workouts continued. There have been some minor injuries, but nothing too serious. Coach Wally Lemm is satisfied so far with the workouts. The Oilers are expecting attendance by over 30.000 for the preseason game with Buffalo. Apparently, Don Meredith's announced retirement isn't expected to dampen enthusiasm, especially around here in Houston. Mario Andretti won the 200 mile Trenton Auto Race Sunday and is now the leading race driver in the U.S. Auto Club's point standings. And that's about the summary of the morning news this afternoon in Houston. Over.


LMP
Look up the Dow Jones Industrials for us.


CC
Roger. Stand by a minute, please.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We see you in P00. When you can give us ACCEPT, we have a state vector and target load uplink ready for you.







LMP

CC
Apollo 11, we've completed the uplink. The computer's yours.


CMP
Thank you.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


LMP
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. With respect to the Dow Jones industrials, since closing on Tuesday afternoon the 15th up to about 1:05 p.m. Houston time this afternoon, why, the effect has been a net drop; that is, minus 6 points on the industrial average. So far today since opening, the Dow Jones industrial average has gone down by 11.05 after rising 1 1/2 shortly after opening. Today's performance on the utilities is a drop of 1.63, and railroads a drop of 1.58. Over.


CMP
Every flight has to have some disadvantages, I guess.


CC
Roger. There is some speculation that you all are responsible for that 1 1/2 point rise right after opening.


CMP
Well, don't blame the 11 point drop on us, anyway.


CC
Roger.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you have a minute or so free, I wonder if we could get Mike to give us a little bit of clarification on what happened around about the time of docking. We copied him as mentioning that contact was very smooth, almost imperceptible; and we're a little bit inquisitive or curious about his remarks as to what happened after probe retraction. Over.


CMP
Roger. I docked in CMC AUTO, and as I said, I wasn't really sure of the moment of contact. I kept cross checking the docking probe indicators. I got two barber poles indicating that the three capture latches - not capture latches, but the three ... latches had made, and we were soft







docked. And at that time the situation looked very stable. So, I went to CMC FREE, glanced back out the window and it still looked stable; and I fired primary 2 bottle. And at that time, a gyration began between the two vehicles due I'm not sure to what. Perhaps the LM thrusting or perhaps it was building up prior, and I hadn't noticed it. But anyway, during the RETRACT of the probe, there were yaw - my yaw excursions of, I would guess, around 15 degrees, and I had to come back on, take the FREE switch and throw it back to AUTO, and try to damp them out; and I guess Neil was doing the same in the LM. I'll let him tell you about his side of it. And I though that we were not going to get a successful RETRACT and hard dock. However, in about - oh, I guess 6 or 8 seconds, I did hear - could see the situation damping out, and then we heard the noise indicating the docking latches had fired; and later on when I got into the tunnel, all 12 of them had properly engaged.


CC
Roger.


CDR
And on the LM side, we were in AGS MIN deadband ATT HOLD; and at contact, I thrusted plus X; and shortly after that we had a sizable attitude oscillation and thruster firing, so we opened up the deadband to MAX and manually flew the vehicle into stable attitude during the retraction. It went to OFF after ...


CC
Roger. Thank you very much. Out.

CC
Roger. If Neil has a free minute, we've got a question or two regarding the CO2 partial pressure and water in the suit loop discrepancies noted yesterday. Over.


CDR
Go ahead.


CC
Roger, 11. Was water noted in both suits or only in yours, Neil?


CDR
I think only in my suit.


CC
Okay. Can you locate that occurrence for us in time when you first noticed water in the suit, either by mission time or relation to any particular event?


CDR
I think it was after insertion sometime, Bruce. I don't remember exactly when. I - It was when we were in orbit and had our - after we took our helmets off.


CC
Roger. Did you call it to us when you first noticed it, or was it sometime after when you called it?


CDR
I'd guess it might have been probably 20 minutes after I noticed it that I mentioned it to you.


CC
Roger. Was this noticing the water accompanied by erratic CO2 partial pressure readings, or was that a separate problem? Over.







CDR
Well, the water problem evidenced itself before we noted any erratic motions of the PC02 gage.


CC
Roger. And what was the relative sequence on selecting water separator number 2 and the secondary CO2 canister; that is, did you go to the secondary water separator first and then the secondary CO2? Over.


LMP
I believe we went to secondary CO2 first.


CDR
Secondary hydroxide - lithium hydroxide.


CC
Roger. We copy. And was there any change in your suit loop - -


CDR
No.


CC
Go ahead.


LMP
I should mention, Bruce, that when I went to water secondary - water separator to secondary there, I didn't notice any change. But about after 15 minutes or 20 minutes, the water stopped coming out. So maybe that was just water that was already in the loop that was still blowing out, but the secondary water separator was operating properly.


CC
Roger. Did you make any changes in the suit loop configuration after you went from the egress mode to the cabin mode after insertion; that is, in particular, they're interested in knowing if you recall changing the diverter valve position to EGRESS at any time while you were on the secondary canister? Over.


CMP
No. I don't believe we did that at all, Bruce.


CC
Okay, 11. Thank you. That sums up our questions for now, and we'll crank these back into the engineering pipeline and see what we can come up with.


LMP
Okay. Are you satisfied that the CO2 circuit breaker was in on jettison? Over.


CC
Say again, please?







LMP
Roger. On LM jettison, are you satisfied that the CO2 circuit breaker was in? Over.


CC
Yes. It was in.


LMP
Roger. Could you confirm that? I thought there was some question after we got into the command module as to whether that had been left in or not. Over.


CC
Roger, 11. It was in and confirmed in, and the readings after jettison stayed about 0.1 to 0.2.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We have not noticed any change in the signal coming through on the LMP's EKG. When he has a little free time, we'd like him to check into it again. Over.


LMP
Roger. I looked at all three of the upper chest center ones, and they appear to be fairly tight. I'll push them back in again. Over.


CC
Roger. On the TM here, we noticed some fluctuations that may have been attributed to your moving the sensors around or pushing on them, but the erratic problem seems to be persisting.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.


CC
11, this is Houston. Over.


LMP
Roger. I wonder if you've noticed any change in the BIOMED returns you're getting. Over.


CC
Negative, Buzz. It still looks kind of bad. Apparently, when you move around, it's cutting in and out. Have you checked the little electrical connector where it goes into the signal conditioner? Over.


LMP
Yes. They're all about as tight as can be. I tell you what; I'll take them off and put them back on again and see if that makes any difference.


CC
Okay. If you would, at your convience, we'll be watching it down here.

Okay. Do you have us on high bit rate here now?


CC
That's affirmative.


CDR
Okay, good. I'll maneuver back to PTC initiation attitude while you guys look at the data and see what you think.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. While you're waiting for the CSM to settle down and for us to look at the tapes on your latest maneuver, would you feel like answering some more questions with relation to the lunar surface? Over.


CDR
Go ahead.


CDR
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. For 64 thousand dollars, we're still trying to work out the location of your landing site, Tranquility Base. We think it is located on LAM 2 chart at Juliet 0.5 and 7.8. Do you still have those charts on board? Over.


CDR
Yes. Stand by one. They're packed.


CC
Roger. You may not have to unpack it. The position which I just gave you is slightly west of West Crater. I guess it's about two tenths of a kilometer west of it, and we were wondering if Neil or Buzz had observed any additional landmarks during descent, lunar stay, or ascent which would confirm or disprove this. One thing that we're wondering about is that if you were at this position, you would have seen the Cat's Paw during ascent just up to the north of your track. Over.


CDR
We were looking for the Cat's Paw, too, thinking we were probably downrange, beyond the Big V. But I think that it's likely that that might have been West Crater that we went across in landing, but - Stand by.


CDR
We're hoping, Bruce, that our 16 mm film was working at that point in descent, and we'll be able to confirm our touchdown position. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters, and crater rows, and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't been able to yet.

Roger. And the next question from our panel is for Buzz. We recall that he reported seeing a laser upon AOS of the Earth the first time after - the first REV after ascent, and we're wondering what color the beam was and if he could determine at the approximate location with respect to the Earth. Over.


LMP
It was mostly white, perhaps a tinge of yellowish color to it; and it seemed to be - as I recall it, the terminator of the Earth was toward the horizon and seemed to be about a quarter to a third of the way down from - down towards the terminator of the Earth - from the opposite horizon. That's a third to a quarter Earth radii. Over.


CC
Roger. And that puts it in the light side? Over.


LMP
Roger. Yes, it was in the light side. The Earth was about - a two thirds lit Earth, with the terminator down toward the horizon. And now coming from the opposite limb of the Earth, the sunlight limb, coming down about one quarter to one third of a radius in from the limb. Generally, pensively located with respect to a line drawn perpendicular to the terminator that goes through the center. Over.


CC
Roger, Buzz. We copy.


LMP
And I got pictures of that. I'm sure that will show up.


CDR
And I saw that, too. It was a very bright spot of light and I confirm Buzz's observation of its position.


CC
Okay, 11. Very good. Now, with respect to the documented sample container: on television it appeared to us as though the samples for that container were in fact being given - being selected in accordance with some thought or consideration being given to the rocks themselves. And we were wondering if you could give any further details from memory about any of these samples, and the context of the material or the surface from which they were taken. Over.







CDR
Yes. You remember I initially started on the cut side of the LM that the TV camera was on, and I took a number of samples of rocks on the surface, and several that were just subsurface - about 20 - 15 to 20 feet north of the LM. And then I recalled that that area had been probably swept pretty well by the exhaust of the descent engine, so I crossed over to the southern side of the LM, and took a number of samples from the area around the elongate double crater that we commented on, and several beyond that, and tried to take as many different types - of rock types as I could see by eye - as I could in the short time we had available. There were a number of other samples that I had seen earlier in our stroll around the LM that I had hoped to get back and pick up and put in the documented sample, but I didn't get those, and I'll be able to comment in detail when we get in the debriefing session.


CC
Roger. Did you observe any small craters with conspicuously blocky rims? Over.


CDR
Well, aside from the one big one that we went over, I guess there were none in our area. I took a stroll back after putting up the EASEP, and while Buzz was starting to unpack the documented samples - took a stroll back to a crater behind us that was maybe 70 or 80 feet in diameter and 15 or 20 feet deep, and took some pictures of it. It had rocks in the bottom of pretty good size, considerably bigger than any that were out on the surface, but there was no - we apparently, at 15 feet or so, had not gotten below the regolith. We were essentially showing no bedrock, at least in the walls of the crater at that depth. Over.


CC Roger. We copy,


CC
Okay. Thank you, Neil. That about wraps up the questions we have on hand for now.


CDR
Okay.


CDR
My compliments to the chef. The food is outstanding. This cream of chicken soup I give at least three spoons.







CC
Okay. Cream of chicken, three spoons.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.

Go ahead.


CC
11, we concur that having VERB 16, NOUN 20 up on the DSKY may well have had some effect on your PTC initiation. It looks like this would give - let the computer work with a knowledge of the actual CDU angles. What we'd like you to do is do a CDU zero which is VERB 40, NOUN 20, ENTER, and then start the PTC procedure again at step 2 with loading VERB 6, NOUN 22, desired attitude in the AUTO maneuver, and all that. Over.


CMP
Okay. The only thing I don't understand about that is why it took off at the rate it did. What rate should it have taken off at under that theory?

Stand by a minute, Mike.

11, CMP, this is Houston. Over.


CMP
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Mike, over here on page 9 7 of your checklist where we're setting up PTC, there's been a note penciled in after, "Wait 20 minutes for rate to damp. Do not monitor VERB 16, NOUN 20." It turns out that the significance of that is that, if you are monitoring 16 NOUN 20, then when you get down here in step 7, the second time you do a VERB 24, you've got to reload the NOUN 01 to make it VERB 24, NOUN 01, ENTER, before you load the three registers. Over.

11, Houston. The radios are still in good shape, and we are still waiting for your rates to decay. We've got 0.03 degrees per second in pitch now.


 CMP
Okay. We're - we're in no rush. This is a very pleasant attitude, as a matter of fact. The Sun is down in the LEB, so it's not shining through the windows and heating the place up.

A 50 degree roll attitude will probably give us that, Joe.


CC

That's a good one because it puts the Earth out window 1 and the Moon out window 3 and puts the Sun down in the LEB, so the lighting in here remains relatively constant.

Roger.


CDR
We know there's a lot of scientists from a number of countries standing by to see the lunar samples, and we thought you'd be interested to see them as they really are here. These two boxes are the sample return containers. They - They're vacuum packed containers that were closed in a vacuum on the lunar surface, sealed, and then brought inside the LM and put inside these fiber glass bags, zippered, and resealed around the outside, and placed in these receptacles in the side of the command module. These are the two boxes. And as soon as we get onto the ship,







I'm sure these boxes will immediately be transferred and delivery started to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. These boxes include the samples of the various types of rock, the groundmass of the soil, the sand and silt, and the particle collector for the solar wind experiment, and the core tubes that took depth samples of the lunar surface.

Five by now, Buzz. Over.


LMP
Okay. The more mundane affairs, now that we've left the Moon, I'd like to trace through them a little bit for you *** developments that have taken place in the food department. I'm sure you've already *** type of a drink container. A little later, Mike will show you how the water gun operates with its new filter to take out the hydrogen. Essentially, this water gun is put in this end and fills up this bag with water, and the drink then dissolves in the water, and this end of the *** outfeeding. Likewise, we have other foods that are more solid nature. You can


probably see this shrimp cocktail meal. *** this afternoon while the two of us had salmon salad. *** another early development was the use of bite size food ***


CC
11, Houston. Buzz, you're breaking up badly. Will you check your VOX? Over.


LMP
Roger. How am I coming through now, Charlie?


CC
Roger. You're very clear when you come through. It's just that your VOX is not keying at every word. Over.


LMP
Okay. These bite sized objects were designed to remove the problem of having so many crumbs floating around in the cabin, so they designed a particular size that would be able to go to the mouth all at once. I think since all of our experience, we've discovered that we could progress a good bit further than that back some of the type meals that we have on Earth. As a matter of fact, on this flight we've carried along pieces of bread, and along with the bread we have a ham spread; and I'll show you, I hope, how easy it is to spread some ham while I'm in zero g.


LMP
I think we've discovered that it is quite easy to *** you're all very familiar with.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We notice your roll rate increasing. Will you please see if you can bring that down to about 04 or we'll be losing high gain shortly. Over.


LMP
You can also use zero gravity to demonstrate many things that we've all learned in school. I'd like to demonstrate briefly how easy it is to explain the action of the gyroscope. If I spin this can, we know that according to the equations of motion that we would expect that once this is given a spin, and has a spin axis in this direction, if we give it a particular torque, and I'll do this by pushing my hands against it in this fashion once it's spinning. By the equations we can predict that, as I put this torque on it, it will in fact rotate this direction. Let's see how well this works out.


LMP
See that as I apply the torque this way, it's rotated this way.


CMP
Too close, I think.


CC
11, Houston. It's a pretty good demonstration.


CMP
Houston, this next is a little demonstration for the kids at home, all kids everywhere, for that matter. I was going to show you how you drink water out of a spoon, but I'm afraid I filled the spoon too full and if I'm not careful, I'm going to spill water right over the sides. Can you see the water slopping around on the top of the spoon, kids?


CC
That's affirmative, 11.


CMP
Okay. Well, as I said, I was going to show you but I'm afraid I filled it too full and it's going to spill over the sides. I'll tell you what. I'll just turn this one over and get rid of the water and start all over again. Okay?


CC
Okay.


CMP
And you can see, up here we don't know where over is. One up is as good as another. That really is water, though. I'll show you.


CMP
That's really not the way we drink. We really have a water gun which I'll show you.


CMP
Here's the water gun. This cylindrical thing on the end of it is a filter with several membranes: one allows water to pass, but not any gas; the other allows gas to pass, but not any water. So, by routing the gaseous water which comes from our tank through this filter, we're enabled to drink purified water without the gas in it, filtered water. And, of course, all we do to - to get it started is just pull the trigger.


CMP
It's sort of messy. I haven't been at this very long. It's sort of the same system that the Spaniards used to drink out of wineskins at bull fights, only I think this is even more fun. Well, be seeing you, kids.







CC
Thank you from all us kids in the world, here in the MOCR, who can't tell the Earth from the Moon.

Apollo 11, Houston. We were curious to see if there was any excess moisture up around the tunnel hatch area as we saw on 10. Over.


CMP
It just so happens that's what we were talking about now. There is a little bit of dampness around the outside edge of the hatch, but a very, very slight amount. We've got a hose up there that we're hoping will sort of help keep it a little bit dry.







CC
Roger, Mike. Thank you much. Have you seen any more water collecting on the aft bulkhead? Over.

How's the weather down there? You got any rain?


CC
Roger. We've been having a little bit, thunderstorm type, the last couple of days. We had a pretty good rain today, smd it's been overcast. A slow storm system's been moving through the area in the last couple of days, and primarily evening and afternoon thundershowers.


CMP
Roger. We were watching a few clouds in your area through the monocular along the Texas Gulf Coast this afternoon, and we also noticed there were clouds over Baja California, which is a little bit unusual.


CC
Roger. Thank you for the weather report. We can't quite see that far. It seems to have







cleared up outside now, according to some of the people coming in. This constant overcast in the MOCR here is a little hard to see outside.

Hey, Charlie, what's the preliminary outlook for the weather in our recovery are%?


CC
Stand by Buzz. It looks pretty good as far as I could tell. We got the - along the tropical convergence line there, there's a few clouds shown on the weather map I'm looking at here, but nothing of significance. Right now - Stand by. Let's see, right now in the mid - yes, at the MPL - we've got 3000 scattered, visibility 10, waves height 3 feet, is the present weather. I don't think there's anything forecast to be of significance. There are a couple of - FLIGHT just informed me that what I just gave you was the forecast.







are a couple of tropical storms in the - well, not in the area of landing but in the Pacific. A storm called Claudia which is north - correction - about east of Hawaii. It's going northwest and dissipating. And there's one called Viola, which is out over Guam, and so they aren't any factor at all. It looks like it's going to be real nice for recovery.


CC
Navy called up those special calm seas for you guys from up there on the Hudson.


LMP
Well, we might need it. We'll get a look at it tomorrow, I guess, though. We'll probably be giving it a pretty close eye.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. The RETRO's were wondering if you could fill us in on any non nominal stowage that we have on board. Just location and weight is about all they're interested in. Over.

And, Apollo 11, Houston. Would you please place O2 tank 1 heater to AUTO? Over.


CMP
AUTO it is.


CDR
Houston, Apollo 11.

What we'll do Charlie, tomorrow, is go through and reconfigure our stowage as closely as possible to nominal. Some things that will not be nominal are as follows: the EVA visors were brought back into the command module, and we have not yet found a home for them. We'll let you know where they go. In addition, there's about 5 pounds of miscellaneous weight from the LM







in compartment Able 8, and it's taking the place of the LCG's which we moved from A 8 into the suit bag. We got rid of one miscellaneous trash bag, mostly old food wrapping and also old underwear and that helmet protective visor of the CMP's. We left all that with Eagle. And those are about the only off nominals we have.


CC
Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Out.

Apollo 11, Houston. We got the rates looking copacetic. You can go ahead and initiate PTC. Over.


CMP
Okay. Thank you.


CC
And Buzz, we're still not getting any data from your EKG. It looks like the only way that we're going to be able to get any is if, at your convenience, you would take your - change out your EKG leads, which are the center ones that are connected to the blue pin; and there's a spare one in the medical box. Over.


LMP
Roger. How many did you want me to change?


CC
Just the center one. I'll get the right nomenclature from the Doc. Stand by. It's called the sternal EKG, which are the three center ones, and it's got - they lead into a - into the blue stringed lead ones. Over.

Okay. There's three of them, is that right?


CC
That's affirmative.


LMP
And you want me to change all three.


CC
That's affirmative and they're all hooked together from the picture I'm looking at, and they go into the center belt, signal conditioner, and it's got the blue strain relief on it.


LMP
Yes. I checked the connectors at both ends on that. I don't guess we have a spare signal conditioner or anything like that, do we?


CC
No. We do not.


LMP
Well, I can show you my heart's still working.


CC
We believe it.


CDR
Charlie, what we suggest here is, before we start that, turn our two suit powers off and plug his blue lead into my blue signal conditioner and see if we can get his signal through my signal conditioner. Okay?


CC
Roger. That's a good suggestion, Neil. We concur. Over.


LMP
Okay, Charlie. We're transmitting, and let's see if you get any EKG signal on the CDR at this point.


CC
Roger. Stand by.


CC
11, Houston. We get some data, but it's got the same problem that we had through Buzz's signal conditioner, so apparently the lead is broken and we'd like you to change it out if you could. Over.


LMP
Okay.


CC
Thank you.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11.

Go ahead, 11. Over.


LMP
Roger. How do you read my EKG now?

Stand by. We'll let the docs look at it. Buzz, we're on low bit rate. We'll get you on a high gain momentarily, and we'll let you know then. Over.


LMP
Okay. I got my high gain antenna coming out.


CC
Roger. Just leave on REACQ. We'll get you.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz, your EKG looks good now. The doc said thanks a lot.


LMP
Okay. They're welcome.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Based on our sighting since the midcourse, we're showing a gamma of minus 6.57. This is preliminary, though, and we think that after some more tracking it should come on in, and we could tweak it right on into the corridor. It's just about in the center of the corridor; everything's looking fine. We'll have you an entry PAD in a couple of hours before you go to sleep. And from our friends in public affairs, a few headlines, other than your flight. You're still dominating the news. However, there are some other things of interest for you. As I mentioned earlier, the All Star game was rained out. It's going to be played tomorrow. However, President Nixon will not be able to see it as he planned. We'll keep you posted on results. And, also, the weathermen are going to be good to you. Our forecast is, looks like it's holding good for the recovery area; it should be real fine out there. President Nixon, as he prepares to fly out to greet







your return, predicted that within 31 years man will have visited at least one other planet bearing some form of life. "In the year 2000, we, on this Earth, will have visited new worlds where there will be a form of life," he told 2000 foreign exchange students at the White House. Before he left for his week long trip, the President sent Congress his proposal for organizing - reorganizing the Interstate Commerce Commission. He also conferred with chairman Earl Wheeler of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on his return from Viet Nam, and the launch of Intelstat was scrubbed and has been rescheduled for 10 p.m., eastern daylight time on Wednesday. The second stage fuel ground support system showed some contamination.

And back in Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to tax changes affecting oil companies, banks, and utilities that could add nearly 2 billion a year to federal revenue. And, also today, NASA announced it will launch a large orbital workshop in 1972, with a cutdown version of the Saturn V. And, your television pictures attracted a lot of interest. They were shown live throughout just about the whole world, and, we're expecting hundreds of telephone calls from mothers all over the world complaining that their youngsters are trying to drink milk from spoons, thanks to you, Mike.


CMP
I take it all back.


CC
You need more practice.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Buzz, you brought the surgeon right out of his chair. We see you exercising. Over.


CDR
Say again.


CC
We see you exercising. Is that correct, Buzz?


CDR
Yes, that's right. Buzz is.


CC
Roger. We've got his heartbeat way up.


CDR
Right. He's sort of out of shape.


CC
Yes. That's what we thought.

Say again, Mike. Over.


CMP
Say the old White Team's really got a busy one tonight, huh?


CC
Oh, boy. We're really booming along here with all this activity. Can barely believe it.


CMP
What are you doing? Sitting around with your feet up on the console drinking coffee?


CC
(Laughter) You must have your X ray eyes up. You sure can see a long way.


CMP
Yes. We're watching you as well, you know.


CC
All right.


CMP
Two people in the viewing room and that's more than is in the trench.


CC
We've got eight in the viewing room, and let's see, about six in the trench right now. And this is the highlight of the day; Buzz's exercise for the surgeon.


CC
11, you copy? Over.


CDR
Roger. 11.


CC
Roger. Neil has the highest heartbeat ever seen on a manned space flight, and we just went low bit rate. The surgeon is about to die. (Laughter)


CDR
I measured it up here. It came out to be 247.


CC
Boy, that's super.


CMP
The unit's on that furlong per fortnight.


CC
Roger. We copy that. EECOMM says if you keep that up, you're going to have to change your CO2 canister.







CMP
You were going to make me do that in another 45 minutes anyway.

That's the highlight of my day. I'm really looking forward to that.

Thank you, 11. We appreciate you turning that off. (Laughter)


CDR
Charlie, could you copy our music down there?


CC
Did we copy what, Neil?


CDR
Did you copy our music down there?


CC
Roger. We sure did. We're wondering who selected - made your selections?


CDR
That's an old favorite of mine, about - It's an album made about 20 years ago, called "Music Out of the Moon."


CC
Roger. It sounded a little scratchy to us, Neil. Either that or your tape was a little slow.


CDR
It's supposed to sound that way.


CC
That's one of those - -


CMP
- - it sounds a little scratchy to us too, but the czar likes it.


CC
That's what we figured. He and his 40,000 votes.

For your info, we got you - It looks like about 150,000 out now.

CMP
It's getting appreciably larger now. It's looklng more like the world.

Roger. I'm looking at the right side of the screen this time.


CMP
How's everything going on the - Say again, Charlie?







CC
Oh, just - I -I'll never hear the last of that one about that Earth/Moon business during the TV there, and I was just saying that I was looking at the right side of the board here, so you are going towards the Earth. What are - What were you going to say, Mike?


CMP
You'll have - You'll have fun at the press conference after this shift then, won't you?


CC
It's 2:30. Everybody will be asleep. I going to sneak off through the back way.


CMP
Okay. I was just wondering how everything is going at the home front. All the wives and kids in one piece?


CC
Roger. Sure are. Everything's doing fine. All the gals are having a little party tonight, as far as I know.


CMP
Oh, good. Glad to hear it.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. I was just reading some of the transcripts of earlier today about this earlier PTC that we attempted, and when you keyed into VERB 24 and did the two ENTER's, it took off on you. I think we got a story on that, if you'd like to listen to why it had such a high rate, Mike. Over.


CMP
Yes. I'm all ears.


CC
Okay. I think it would be better if you got your checklist out on 97, and we could walk you through it, and that way I could probably get the story straight. Over.


CMP
Okay. I got it.


CC
Okay. Mike, what happened is - you know, you were sitting there monitoring VERB 16, NOUN 20, and at step 7 you went into VERB 24, NOUN 01, and keyed in the address and then INFORMATION INFORMATION; and on the final ENTER of that 35400 ENTER, right after that, it - that then put you back into the 16, NOUN 20. Then when you did the VERB 24, ENTER, you were really entering the information in the actual CDU; and when you got the two entries in, in register 1 and 2, it was an - it was an instantaneous change in the actual CDU, and the CM DAP looked at that and saw - saw what it thought it







had. My - my gosh, I got a 600 degree per second rate. And it turns on the jets to try to take that rate out. And the rate filters that it's looking at - it - well, the rate it's looking at is filtered, so it doesn't really sense the actual rate until the thing is already built up, and then it starts reading the rate filters, and it says, "Well, I really didn't have 600 degrees." So then it turns it off and tries to slow it down. But until that happens, and it is some time lag, and that's why the rate was building up. The jets were on, and they were going to stay on due to that instantaneous 600 - suspected 600 degree per second rate. Over.


CMP
Okay. I got you.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Man.


LMP
Hey, Charlie, are you saying that for a short period of time, he actually loaded NOUN 20 with some value other than was being read by the CDU?


CC
I think I got that, Buzz. That's affirmative. But when he did that second VERB 24, you were - the NOUN was 20, so when he did the 3175 and then a 002 ENTER, what he actually did there was load the first two actual CDU locations, and the computer looked at it - the DAP looked at it as an instantaneous change in the actual CDU. Stand by on your comments. We're switching antennas.


LMP
Roger.


CC
- - We're very scratchy.


LMP
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. We got you back now on the high gain. Did you copy all that, Buzz? Over.


LMP
Yes. I think so. I - I thought maybe that NOUN 20 was one of those that you could never load from the DSKY, and that still maybe. Maybe it was loaded just for the short period of time, and then when the counters read the - the gimbal angles, why they changed it back to what they actually are. But in the meantime, the DAP saw this different number. Is that right?







CC
Well, our guidance guy was telling me that you can actually load those ACDU's, the actual CDU's, but we'll - we're checking on that. Over.


LMP
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. Buzz, the word from the back room is that you can actually load the NOUN 20, but you should not.


LMP
Yes. I got that. Thank you.


CC
You're welcome.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We got a recommendation for you on your stowage of the EVVA's. Over.


LMP
Go ahead.


CC
Okay. We'd like - the SPAN guys say it looks - they think that one would go on the helmet that you're going to have in B1, and you could put the other one on Mike's helmet, which will be in the sleep restraint. Over.


CDR
I doubt if it will fit on the helmet in B1. The other one might - might go in the sleep restraint. We've got them in our helmet bags, and I guess we're going to have to keep the helmets in the helmet bags, and the LEVVA's in the LEVVA bags.


CC
Roger.


CDR
Yes. I've been thinking maybe they ought to stay sealed up.


CC
Okay. We - -


CMP
It won't hack B1, Charlie, with the cover. I tried it already.


CC
Okay. Fine. We weren't sure of that. It was just a suggestion. We thought we'd - You check it out. Sounds like you've already done that, so I guess whatever you can come up with, just let us know.


LMP
Okay. There's no problem. We'll let you know where they end up.

Eyeballing my Magellanic clouds. Over.

11, Houston. Got your signals loud and clear, here. How are things this morning? Over.


CDR
Do you read us, Owen?


CC
Roger. Loud and clear, 11.


CDR
Okay. Everything *** to be all right here. So far, we haven't been looking in the cockpit yet. We've been spending our time looking outside the cockpit. ***


CC
Roger, 11. You're breaking up just a little bit there, Neil. Your signals are loud but are breaking up occasionally. Your spacecraft all looks good here from the ground. We noticed you stirring around the cockpit and thought we'd give you a call. Over.


CDR
Good morning.


CC
11, Houston. We do have a few items for you here, entry PAD's, consumables, and so forth. After you've had a chance to get organized, whenever you're ready to start on a few of these items, why, we'll read them up to you. Over.


LMP
Okay. Stand by.


LMP
Go ahead, Owen. I've got the book now. I'm ready to copy.


CC
Okay, Buzz. On your flight plan items, a few updates first of all. We've cancelled midcourse number 6. Just remain - remain in PTC. I'll give you a little more time this morning. Second item on the flight plan is we're ready for a BATT B charge anytime you want to put it on the line; and third item, we'd like a waste water dump a little differently this time. We'd like


to do it on our marks from the ground. The PTC is a little bit ragged, and we would like to make the water dump at a time which we think will hold it in its proper configuration, so it looks like we'll have a desirable opportunity coming along in - between 15 and 20 minutes. And on our mark, we would like to have a waste water dunp down to about 40 percent. I'll give you a more accurate level for the water dump a little later. Over.


LMP
Roger. You must have stayed up all night figuring this one out.


CC
11, Houston. Stand by just a moment here until we get out of the NO position on the antenna.


CC
11, Houston. We're over on OMNI Delta now. I think we can read you better. Did you get all those first three items on your flight plan update? Over.


LMP
I got midcourse correction cancelled; battery B charge and water dump on your call. Over.


CC
That's right, Buzz; and the last item here, we do request that we do a P52, even though we're not doing midcourse correction; and we suggest you get to that after the waste water dump has been complete. We also have a state vector update for you, if you can give us P00 and ACCEPT. Over.


LMP
Okay. You have the DSKY now.


CC
Roger. We'll be sending that up, and I'll give you your consumables update now. It's - for a time of 170 hours, your RCS total is minus 3.5 percent, Alfa is minus 14.5, Bravo plus 7, Charlie minus 4.5, Delta minus 3; hydrogen total is minus 1, and your oxygen total is plus 24. Over.


CMP
Roger. Copy those. And onboard readouts, D is 69, C is 73, D is - Let me start over again. Okay. A is 51 and B is 62; C is 63 and D is 59. Over.


CC
Roger, 11. Copy those, and we've checked them here on the ground, also. One correction to my last transmission. We would like that P52 prior to the waste water dump, which is coming up in about 30 minutes from now. Will that be possible? Over.







CMP
Oh, yes. We'll take care of that.


CC
Roger. And if you're ready for an entry PAD, I'll read that up to you now, also, 11.


CMP
Ready to copy.


CC
Okay. Entry PAD is area MIDPAC: 359 153 001 194 46 03 267, plus 1102, minus 17203 067 36194 655 11875 36275 195 03 03 00 28; DL and VL, all four are not applicable; DO, 4 00 02 10 00 18 03 38 08 21 44 2932 380; boresight star is Scorpio Theta, up 314, right 34, lift vector up. Comments: Entry data assumes no midcourse maneuvers. Your earth entry: minus 30 minutes; horizon check, 194 plus 33 plus 03. Your pitch is 297. This assumes an entry REFSMMAT. Your GDC align stars are Deneb and Vega. Roll, pitch, yaw, 078, 233, 340. Read back. Over.

CMP
Roger.


CDR
Okay, Houston. The crew status report is 8 1/2, 7, and 8.


CC
11, Houston. Roger, Neil. 8 1/2, 7, and 8 for your crew status.


CDR
Right.


CC
11, Houston. Your P52 looks good here on the ground, and we are now estimating that water dump will occur along about 171 plus 40; and we'd like for you to dump to 45 percent. This should let you arrive at Earth interface with just about a full load of waste water. Over.


CDR
Understand 171 40, approximately, 40 percent.







CC
11, Houston. We'd like to advance the time on that water dump to about 171 plus 30 just after we reacquire on the next 0MNI, and - as I mentioned, it'll be down to 45 percent - is the new quantity. Also, we're standing by for your CM RCS ejector temperature readout. Over.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. I'm not certain you copied my last transmission, as we were just in the process of switching OMNI's. We'd like to advance the time on that water dump until about 5 minutes from now. And we'll give you a precise mark on the time to start the dump, and we are standing by for a readout on your CM RCS ejector temperatures. Over.


CMP
Okay, Owen. We're standing by for your mark, and stand by for the readout.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Are you ready to copy ejector temperatures? I'll read them in volts.


CC
That's affirmative. Go ahead, Mike.


CMP
Okay. 2 4 is reading 4.7 volts, 2 5 is reading 4.8 volts, 1 2 is reading 4.8 volts, 1 4 is reading 4.8, 1 6 4.5, and 2 1 4.8. Over.


CC
11, Houston. Roger. Those - I got them all.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready for you to start your waste water dump at this time. Over.


CMP
Roger. Dumping.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We show you - -


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We've dumped to 45 percent, and we're stopping now. Do you concur?


CC
Roger, 11. We concur.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. I can read up your forecast weather for the recovery any time you'd like to hear about it. Over.


LMP
Go ahead.







CC
11, Houston. Present forecast shows acceptable conditions in your recovery area: 2000 foot scattered, high scattered, wind from 070 degrees, 13 knots, visibility 10 miles, and sea state about 4 feet. The forecast yesterday showed a tropical storm, Claudia, some 500 to 1000 miles east of Hawaii. The - the pictures from Earth satellites taken yesterday afternoon - afternoon showed Claudia dissipating, so this appears to be even less a factor than it was before. Your recovery area is now believed to be just a little ways north of the intertropical convergence zone, which you can probably see when you look out your windows there. Yesterday there was also a report of a tropical storm, Viola, further to the west. Its present location is some thousand miles east of the Phillipines and moving northwest. Tropical storm Viola has been intensifying, and should be transferred to the typhoon category within the next 12 hours or so; however, that will be far to your west. As a matter of fact, sunrise terminator has not yet reached Viola. When it does several hours from now, you can probably distinguish it from your viewpoint quite readily. As a matter of fact it should be of interest to perhaps take some pictures. Comment on it when you get a chance to see Viola in a few hours. So that's about the present weather state and situation for your recovery area. Over.


CMP
That sounds pretty good ...

Apollo 11, Houston. Over.


CDR
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. Just wanted to make sure you fellows hadn't gone back to sleep again. And I also have a little bit of late news here if you'd like to find out what's happened in the last 12 - 14 hours. Over.


CDR
Okay. Go ahead.


CC
Okey doke. Hot off the press here: We find Juan Carlos was formally designated yesterday - Tuesday - to become General Franco's successor - as the Chief of State of Spain and eventual King. Juan Carlos will be sworn in today as his successor designate after taking an oath of loyalty to the law and the National Movement, Spain's only legal political organization. He will apparently be called the Prince of Spain.


CC
House Ways and Means Committee also has agreed yesterday to tax changes affecting oil companies, also banks and utilities, which could add as much as 2 billion dollars per year to the federal revenue. The committee also voted tentatively to change the accounting procedures for telephone, electric, gas, and oil pipeline companies and to reduce tax benefits of mutual savings and loan institutions. So, it looks as if tax reform may be on the way.


CC
Looking overseas, we find South Korea's first super highway, linking Seoul with the Port of Inchon, has been named the Apollo Highway to commemorate your trip. I think we mentioned last night that President Nixon has already started on his round the world trip, and today he is in San Francisco on his first stop which will take him to the U.S.S. Hornet, from which he'll watch the return of your spacecraft. He plans to visit seven nations including Rumania during this trip. He, as I think you also knew, had to miss the All Star baseball game yesterday, as it was rained out; but it is being played today.







CC
The West Coast residents in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Vancouver, British Columbia; and San Francisco all plan to make their areas visible to the three of you by lighting their lights between 9 pm and midnight tonight, according to the Associated Press. We do have clear weather predicted there, so you may be able to see Christmas lights, porch lights, store lights, and whatever may be turned on.


CDR
Good show.


CC
A little closer to home here, back in Memphis, Tennessee, a young lady who is presently tipping the scales at 8 pounds, 2 ounces, was named "Module" by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Eddie Lee McGhee. "It wasn't my idea." said Mrs. McGhee, "It was my husband's." She said she had balked at the name Lunar Module McGhee, because it didn't sound too good, but apparently they have compromised on just Module. Over.


SC
(Laughter) ...


CC
Roger. Hear a few chuckles coming from that direction. And we do have a late report on the sports here also. The All Star game currently being played. The present score at the end of the fourth inning has the National League leading the American League by 9 to 3. So the hitters are having a good day, you can tell.


CC
And rain clouds are over the MSC area at the moment. It began raining here just about 10 minutes ago, and last report, we were having a pretty heavy deluge. So, that's it from the news front for the afternoon here, Apollo 11. Over.


CDR
Thank you very much, Owen. I think my yard could use some water.


CC
That's very true. I've forgotten exactly how many days it did go, Buzz, but something like 30 days without rain; and we can aprreciate the rain we're getting right now.







LMP
That was Neil. This is Buzz, here. I wish we could find out when the last time my lawn was cut. Over.


CMP
That might be a little more difficult to find out. I'm not sure whether the - whether Mike is ready to admit when he last did the job, but I'll look into that for you.


LMP
Well, he'll tell you. He's got a new mower.

Roger. Joan wasn't home right now, Buzz, but Janis reports the grass is getting pretty high, and I would estimate that it's going to be close to your knees by the time you get out of quarantine. Over.


LMP
Okay. I'll have to schedule a little discussion after I get back.


CC
Roger. And no reports - no report from the chinch bugs there, Mike.


CMP
Well, they're sort of taciturn little fellows. They don't say much; they just chomp away.


CC
Concur on that.


CMP
Which is about what we're doing up here.


CC
We concur on that, too.


CMP
Breakfast was magnificent as usual. I had sliced peaches, sausage patties, two cups of coffee, and I forget all what else.







CC
That does sound pretty good. As a matter of fact, I'm way overdue for a meal myself, here. I could use some of that.


CMP
Why don't you get Milt to give you 5 minutes off and grab a hamburger?


CC
I suggested that awhile ago. He was pointing out about the weight problem here. We've got to keep the calories low, so I'd better stand by without it.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We've been doing a little flight planning for Apollo 12 up here.


CC
Roger. Go ahead.


CMP
We're trying to calculate how much spagetti and meatballs we can get on board for Al Bean.


CC
I'm not sure the spacecraft will take that much extra weight. Have you made any estimates?


CMP
It'll be close.


CC
11, Houston. The medics at the next console report that the shrew is one animal which can eat six times its own body weight every 24 hours. This may be a satisfactory base line for your spaghetti calculations on Al Bean. Over.


CMP
Okay. Thank you. That's in work.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. It was slightly colder in here last night than it has been on any previous night. Does EECOMM notice any change in his data or any explanation for that?


CC
Roger. Stand by just a moment. We've got to check some temperatures.


CMP
Up until last night it was - if anything, a little on the warm side at night. Last night it was on the chilly side.


CC
Roger there. We'll run down the temperatures for the 2 nights.







CMP
Oh, it's no big thing. Just as a matter of interest.


CC
Roger.


CMP
And how'd you like the command module RCS temperatures?


CC
11, Houston. They all look very good. The lowest temperature was 40 degrees, and we're taking a look at your cabin temperatures now.


CMP
We agree on the CM RCS. No heaters are going 2 to be required by a country mile.


CC
We think that's correct.


CMP
We don't like those heaters, anyway, working off the direct coils.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Peculiar thing, Owen, on the platform alignment is that when I really take my time and do a very slow, careful, precise job of marking. I'm getting about the same star angle difference as when I'm doing it in DTC and have to do a hurried rush job with relatively poor tracking. Star angle differences seem insensitive. It almost made me believe there's a very small bias there somewhere in the sextant.


CC
Roger, 11. Perhaps the 3 degrees per second just isn't that much of a bother. Over.


LMP
Well, he's really trying to explain why he can't get all zeros.


CMP
I think Buzz is probably right. As a matter of fact, one time I made a mark which I thought was a little bit in error, but I tho thought, "Well heck. I'll go ahead and see how it works out anyway," and I got five zeros that time. And when I have thought everything was exactly precisely on, I have consistently been getting 0.01.







CC
Roger. Apparently it pays to hurry.


CMP
I usually do.


CMP
The visibility through the telescope has been very poor. It's, I would say, even worse than the simulator is right now. It requires long periods of dark adaptation which most times are most inconvenient; so it's really a tremendous asset to keep the platform powered up at all times and to keep it tweaked within the capability of the sextant field of view.


CC
Understand, Mike.


CC
11, Houston. Checking your temperatures, it does look like the spacecraft may have cooled down perhaps 2 or 3 degrees in the last 24 hours, and that sounds to be consistent with your report on the comfort level there. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CDR
Is that a LM off phenomenon?


CC
11, Houston. It looks like we'll have to think a little more about that, as to whether it's a LM off or some effect of being out of Lunar orbit. We don't know, so we'll have to puzzle before we can give a better answer.


CDR
Okay.


CMP
Well, if the systems guys have anything they want chased down, we'll be happy to give you any readings or reports or what have you.


CC
Roger. We'll think about that and see if there aren't some other tests to be usefully performed here.


CMP
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. I'll be turning things over to the Green CAP COMM at this time, and see you on the ground tomorrow.







CDR
Okay, Owen. I want to thank you and the whole Purple/Maroon group there for a good job helping Apollo 11.


CC
Thank you, sir.


LMP
Thanks from us to all of you. It was really appreciated.


CMP
Great job, you guys.


CC
Roger, out.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


CMP
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.


CC
11, this is Houston. With reference to your subjective evaluation that it felt cooler in side the spacecraft last night, we reported earlier that we did indeed see a drop of about 3 degrees over the previous night. Looking back, it appears the crew of Apollo 10 reported similar feelings during the translunar and transearth coast phases. We're wondering if you could give us any indication of the relative amounts of free or condensed water in the cabin last night and the night before from which we could infer humidity. Over.


CDR
Roger. That might be a little bit difficult to do. We'll take a look at the tunnel now. It does seem as though, between the dirt, we had a little bit more moisture in the tunnel. Of course, the LM hadn't been vented when we did translunar.


CC
Roger. We were more curious about the relative amount of moisture between, say, last night and the night before, both of which would have the LM missing.


CMP
There's more moisture in the tunnel now than there has been at any previous time. Subjectively we have been unable to determine any change in - any buildup in humidity. There appears to be no moisture any other place in the spacecraft. For example, the windows are not fogging or - and various other cool spots around the spacecraft - all of them appear to be completely dry.







CC
This is Houston. Roger. Thank you.


CMP
How are all the "Greens" today, Bruce?


CC
Oh, the Greens are in good shape. The actual Green Team has been here for several hours. We're dogging the watch down here to position Ron for entry. Over.


CMP
Roger. Understand. Did Dave Reed get to explain the lunar ... at the press conference?


CC
No, but your comments about Bill Shaffer and the explanations were quoted in the paper last night.


CMP
Oh, oh.


CC
Do you want to say anything more while you're on the line?


CMP
He's right. He's absolutely right.


CMP
How's old White, Bruce? Did he ever let you go get a cup of coffee when we were over on the back side?


CC
Oh, things have been going pretty smoothly down here. He's really not that hard to get along with.


CMP
Oh, he must be mellowing.


CC
We've only got two of them back here right now.


CMP
He always used to make me sit at the console through the back side passes, just for training.


CC
Well, the word we have here is - that was because whenever you came back, you had to be retrained.


CMP
Touché.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Out of curiosity, on those 70 mm cameras, we figure we exposed around 300 in the LM and around a thousand in the command module; and both cameras - or all the 70 mm cameras worked just fine.


CC
Okay. Very good. Thank you.

Okay. You're coming through loud and clear now, 11, with your patch.


CDR
Good evening. This is the Commander of Apollo 11. A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the Moon. His spaceship, Columbia, took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip to the Moon. It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of the crew as the modern day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet Earth and the same Pacific Ocean tomorrow. First, Mike Collins.


CC
11, this is Houston. We have an LOS here.


CDR
We'll be right back with you.


CC
Roger.


CC
In the interim, you may be interested in knowing that Jan and the children and Pat and the youngsters and Andy Aldrin are down here in the viewing room watching this evening.


CDR
We're glad to hear that.


CC
Okay, 11. You're back on, with Mike in the middle of the screen there.


CMP
Roger. This trip of ours to the Moon may have looked, to you, simple or easy. I'd like to assure you that has not been the case. The Saturn V rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly. This computer up above my head has a 38,000 word vocabulary, each word of which has been very carefullly chosen to be of the utmost value to us, the crew. This switch which I have in my hand now, has over 300 counterparts in the command module alone, this one single switch design. In addition to that, there are myriads of circuit breakers, levers, rods, and other associated controls. The SPS engine, our large rocket engine on the aft end of our service module, must have performed flawlessly, or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit. The parachutes up above my head must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plummet into the







ocean. We have always had confidence that all this equipment will work, and work properly, and we continue to have confidence that it will do so for the remainder of the flight. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people. First, the American workmen who put these pieces of machinery together in the factory. Second, the painstaking work done by the various test teams during the assembly and retest after assembly. And finally, the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center, both in management, in mission planning, in flight control, and last, but not least, in crew training. This operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine. All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all those, I would like to say, thank you very much.


CC
11, this is Houston. We're getting a good picture of Buzz now, but no voice modulation. And would you open up the f stop on the TV camera; try 22, please?


CC
That appears to be a lot better now. We're still not receiving Buzz's audio.


LMP
Good evening. I'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, Apollo 11. As we've been discussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. Neil's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the Moon, "This is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind," I believe sums up these feelings very nicely. We accepted the challenge of going to the Moon; the acceptance of this challenge was inevitable. The relative ease with which we carried out our mission, I believe, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acceptance. Today, I feel we're fully capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of space. In retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously







chose for our spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle. We've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight, depicting the U.S. eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the Earth, from the planet Earth to the Moon; that symbol being the olive branch. It was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the Moon. Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind to me. "When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him."


CDR
The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have through their will, indicated their desire; next, to four administrations, and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, to the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the space suit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft, who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their - their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. To those people, tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.


CC
11, this is Houston. We're getting a zoom view out the window now.


CDR
Apollo 11, signing off.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Do you want to crank up PTC again; do you have some reason to hold its attitude, or what's your pleasure?


CC
You can crank up PTC again, Mike, any time you like. And I might add I thought that was a mighty fine TV presentation. There's certainly nothing I can add to it from down here.


CMP
Thank you.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.







CDR
Go ahead.


CC
Okay, 11. I've got a few small items here: one flight plan update and some entry photography information, if you are ready to copy. Over.


CDR
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. At 180 hours 50 minutes GET, we should like to delete your oxygen fuel cell purge.


CDR
Okay.


CC
And on the entry photography, if you are going to use a fresh magazine of color interior film, we recommend the following exposure settings: f11 at 1/250, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.0, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the chutes open. If you are using a magazine, part of which has already been used for interior shots, we recommend f16 at 1/500 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.8, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the parachutes open. And we would like to know the magazine number that you are intending to use if you have a chance. Over.


CMP
Okay. I think we got those. We will be using a fresh one and it will be color interior. Over.


CC
Roger. When you get - get it out, we would like to have the number of the magazine and the letter of the magazine relayed down.


CDR
Okay. And we're thinking that we might want to run some of that at 12 frames per second. And I think we can get everything from 0.5 - 0.5g down; that will only give us about 7.8 minutes and ... frames ... double that. I guess maybe just an occasional burst to 12 frames would be what we want and the rest of it at six. Over.


CC
This is Houston. That plan sounds fine with us, Neil.


CDR
Okay.


CC
And lastly, we would like to know if your stowage configuration for entry is going to conform to







the nominal. The RETRO's down here are anxious to get an accurate c.g. computed for you, and in particular, where the LEVVA's are being stowed. Over.


CDR
Okay. We think we are going to put the LEVVA's and helmets in the hatch bag, and we'll let you know any other nonstandard stowage locations that we complete this evening.


CC
This is Houston. Roger. Out.


CDR
Houston, Apollo 11.

In compartment A1, the 16 millimeter magazine will be located in window number 4 instead of 5. Tissue dispensers; there is only one of them left. And compartment U3, the 16 millimeter bracket is on window 4, and the PGA bag - add the CMP's PGA, plus add two LCG's. And compartment A8 delete two LCG's, add one PPK, making a total of four, and add 10 pounds of LM miscellaneous equipment. We told you five the other day. We think ten is probably closer. Over.


CC
Copy.


CMP
And that's all the changes on that page. Ready for the next page?


CC
Roger. Go ahead, Mike.







CMP
On your next page, in compartment B1, we estimate about 15 percent of that food is remaining. In B2 we took PPK out of there and put trash in it. In B3, the 16 millimeter cable, the 18 millimeter lens, and the right angle mirror are on window number 4. And that there brings you all up to date.


CC
Roger. How about the LEVVA's, Mike? Where did you put those? Over.


CMP
They're in the hatch bag.


CC
Roger. Stand by. Our only concern, 11, is with the stuff you got in the hatch bag. That's pretty big bulk between you and A8, and we'd like to talk about moving that over to the sleep restraint. If you will stand by. I'll verify that. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. Our recommendation on the gear you got in the helmet bag - correction, hatch bag, would be to remove that stuff and put it in the sleep restraint under the right couch. The reason is that the hatch bag straps are only configured for zero g, and it is a pretty difficult job getting it lashed down. With the gear in the sleep restraint, it's a pretty standard lash down procedure, and you could also use the Beta cord that you have on hoard. You concur? Over.


CMP
Yes. We'll look at it, Charlie, and let you know.


CC
Roger. And I got a couple of other things, Mike. We need to terminate battery B charge at this time, and also, the weather is clobbering in at our targeted landing point due to scattered thunderstorms. We don't want to tangle with one of those, so we are going to move the - your aim point uprange. Correction, it will be downrange, to target for 1500 nautical mile entry so we can guarantee uplift control. The new coordinates are 13 degrees, 19 minutes north, 169 10 minutes west. The weather in that area is super. We got 2000 scattered, 8000 scattered with 10 miles visibility and 6 foot seas and the Hornet is sitting in great position to get to that targeted positton. Over.







CMP
Roger.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Some of the general last minute updates here. On the entry, we had told you on the camera to set it at 50 feet. It turns out the biggest number on the camera is 25 feet, so just set it at infinity. Over.


CMP
Roger. Infinity.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're ready to put you to bed and say good night, if you give us your crew status report and verify that you changed out the CO2 canister a moment ago. Over.

And, 11, Houston. Mike, you get your chance at landing tomorrow. No go around.


CMP
Roger. You're going to let me land closer to Hawaii, too, aren't you?


CC
That's right, sir.


CC
11, Houston. We got some word just a moment ago that the McDonald Observatory is - said they had picked up the spacecraft in their telescope. Over.


CDR
Outstanding. We have been looking for their laser but haven't had much luck yet.

Hello, Houston. Apollo 11.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Go.


CDR
Roger. Good morning. What's the status on midcourse 7?


CC
Roger. We were going to let you sleep in until about 190 hours. Midcourse 7 is not required.


CDR
Okay. Thank you.


CC
Apollo 11. Good morning from Houston. Over.


CDR
Good morning, 11.


CC
Roger. We saw you up stirring around, and we thought that you were probably eating your breakfast there. Just in general, we'll probably start coming up with the uplink of the state vectors and the target loads and what have you at about 190 50, somewhere in that area, and get you started to work.


CDR
Okay.


CC
And in the meantime, while you're eating your breakfast there, I've got the Maroon Bugle all standing by here to give you the morning news.


CDR
Glad to hear it.


CC
Okay. Apollo 11 remains the prime story with the world awaiting your landing today at about 11 49 a.m. Houston time. In Washington, House tax reformers have fashioned a provision which would make it impossible for wealthy individuals to avoid income tax entirely through tax free investments or special allowances. Under the proposal tentatively adopted by the House Ways and Means Committee, everyone would pay taxes on at least half of their income.


CDR
Hang on a minute.


CC
Roger. Standing by.


CDR
Okay. Okay, Ron. We're ready to go again. Thank you.







CC
Roger. Continuing with the Maroon Bugle. President Nixon surprised your wives with a phone call from San Francisco just before he boarded a plane to fly out to meet you. All of them were very touched by your television broadcast. Jan and Pat watched from Mission Control here. The launch of Intelsat from the Cape was postponed for the fourth time last night. The problem was said to be a malfunctioning nitrogen regulator in the second stage of Delta. A new attempt will be made to launch it tonight. The research submarine Ben Franklin, which is studying the Gulf Stream, set a record by drifting 24 hours from 10 to 100 feet above the ocean floor in 1300 feet of water off the Georgia coast. The mission is led by Jacques Picard. Wally Schirra has been elected to a 5 year term on the board of trustees of the Detroit Institute of Technology. He will serve on the Institute's development committee. Air Canada says it has accepted 2300 reservations for flights to the Moon in the past 5 days. It might be noted that more than 100 have been made by men for their mothers in law. And finally, it appears that rather than killing romantic songs about the Moon, you have inspired hundreds of song writers. Nashville, Tennessee, which probably houses the largest collection of recording companies and song publishers in the country, now reports it is being flooded by Moon songs. Some will make it. The song at the top of the best sellers list this week is, "In the year 2525." Morning Bugle. Out.


CDR
Thank you very much, Ron.

Houston, crew status report: 5.5 7 5.5.

We're going to follow your suggestion and stow them under right hand couch.


CC
Roger. Mighty fine. Break. The weather forecast in the landing area right now is 2000 scattered, high scattered, 10 miles. The wind about 080 at 18 knots. You'll have about 3- to 6 foot waves. Your Delta H is plus 10 feet. And it looks like you'll be landing about 10 minutes before sunrise. Over.

You too, huh?


CC
(Laughter) Right.


LMP
Collins has got one, but I'm not sure I buy it.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston.


LMP
Go ahead.


CC
Roger, 11. We don't have to worry about it any more. The altimeter out there is now standard, 29.92; but basically what it means is that if I give you a plus 10 feet, for instance, that means that you will hit the water with the ailtimeter reading 10 feet. Over.


CMP
All right.


LMP
Ah, Collins was wrong.

LMP
Okay. I've got a 233.


CC
Also your DL and MAX and MIN, I'm sure. are 22 400 and 18 000. Over.


LMP
Yes. That's right.


CC
Okay. If you'll dig out your entry checklist there on page E6 1, I'll update your RETRO times there for the various altitudes. Over.


LMP
Okay. Go ahead.


CC
Okay. On page E6 1, your RRT is 07 20, your 50K is 08 16; 40K is 08 30; your 24K is 09 02; and your 10K is 09 51. 0wer.


LMP
Okay. RRT, 07 20, 50 000, 08 16. That's - 07 20 is - is the time of steam pressure peg from RRT; and 40 000, 08 30; 24 000, 09 02; 10 000, 09 51.


CC
11, Houston. You started out right, and then the numbers you read back were correct; but I didn't get your comment in between there.


LMP
I assume that - all I wanted to know is that first time, 07 20, that's the time of steam pressure peg. Right?


CC
That's affirmative.


LMP
Okay.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Ron, I'm ready to copy your message about the constant drag level.







CC
Okay, Mike. Of course, this is in the event the G&amp;N and the EMS quits and you have to fly the constant g; and what we're trying to do is extend the constant g range from 1100 to 1500 miles. We've run this procedure in the simulator, and it works fine. Basically, I'll go through it - just go through it, and then if you have any questions come back. But it's the same lift vector up until MAX g, and then lift vector down, and then modulate the lift vector until g dot goes to zero. Okay. This procedure is essentially the same so far. And then hold g dot zero until you pass the RETRO elapsed time of V circular; and then after you pass this RETRO elapsed time of V circular, roll to a gimbal angle of 45 degrees, and then hold this constant bank angle of 45 degrees until you come to the RETRO elapsed time of drogues. Over.


CMP
Okay. It sounds straightforward enough. Understand constant g backup backup procedure, lift vector up until MAX g and then lift vector down; then modulate until bank angle until g dot equals zero. Maintain g dot equals zero until subcircular, then roll 45 degrees and hold until drogue time. Over.


CC
Okay. That's mighty fine, Mike. That's correct.
