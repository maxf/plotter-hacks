# To do list

# DTS

- Optimize the code. Make rendering faster
- Fewer squiggles when stipple points are close. Maybe space out points more?
- Don't re-render everything when toggling what to show

# Excoffizer

- merge output size the same as input size, to simplify the code. With SVG, it doesn't matter if the output size is the same as the input size

# All

- DONE - Make rendering asynchronous to reduce blocking time, especially for DTS
- DONE - Add thumbnails on the home page
- Small popups to describe parameters
