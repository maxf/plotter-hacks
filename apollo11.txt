CC
Roger. Could you give us comments on how the transposition and docking went? Over.


CMP
I thought it went pretty well, Houston, although I expect I used more gas than I've been using in the simulator. The turnaround maneuver - I went PITCH ACEL COMMAND and started to pitch up, and then when I put MANUAL, ATTITUDE PITCH back to RATE COMMAND for some reason it - it stopped its pitch rate, and I had to go back to ACCEL COMMAND and hit what I thought was an extra PROCEED on the DSKY. During the course of that, we drifted slightly further away from the S IVB than I expected. I expected to be out about 66 feet. My guess would be I was around 100 or so; and therefore, I expect I used a bit more coming back in. But, except for using a little more gas - And I'd be interested in your numbers on that - everything went nominally.


CC
This is Houston. Roger. We copy.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.


CC
Go ahead, 11.







CMP
Roger. We're working on the pressurization of the LM now, and working off the decal with CSM-LM pressure equalization. And we're down to step 13, where we're waiting for the cabin pressure to be 5, or it should be roughly 5, before we turn the REPRESS package O2 valve to FILL. Instead of 5, we're running about 4.4. Over.


CC
Roger. Stand by a second.


CMP
And Houston, Apollo 11. We did put the REPRESS package O2 valve to FILL momentarily there at step 13, and we have filled the bottles back up partially. What's the pressure reading in there, Neil?


CMP
We have about 450 psi now in the three 1-pound bottles.


CC
Roger. Stand by a second, please.


CMP
Roger. Standing by. The REPRESS package valve is now in the OFF position. What's the cabin pressure now, Buzz? Cabin pressure is now 4.5.


CDR
Houston, Apollo 11. We think these readings are within normal tolerances. We just wanted to get your concurrence before we press down any further with these decals.


CC
Okay, Captain.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read?


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.


LMP
Roger. LM looks to be in pretty fine shape from about all we can see from here.


CC
Okay. In reference to your question on this step 13 on the decal, I understand that you have used up the contents of the REPRESS O2 package and at that time, instead of being up to 5 psi, you were reading 4.4. Is that correct?


CMP
Okay. 4.4. Yes sir.


CC
Okay. And you want to know if you can go ahead and use additional oxygen to bring the command module up to 5.0 and continue the equalization? Over.







CMP
Yes. We think it's within normal tolrarances, Bruce. We just wanted to get your concurrence before we press on with this procedure.


CC
Roger, Apollo 11. Go ahead.


CMP
Okay. We're pressing on with the procedure.


CC
And 11, Houston. We have a request for you. On the service module secondary propellant fuel pressurization valve: As a precautionary measure, we'd like you to momentarily cycle the four switches to the CLOSE position and then release. As you know, we have no TM or talkback on these valve positions, and it's conceivable that one of them might also have been moved into a different position by the shock of separation. Over.


CMP
Okay. Good idea. That's being done.


CC
Houston. Roger. Out.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We're doing a nonpropulsive vent on the booster at the present time. You may see some sort of a cloud coming out of it. When you're ready, I have your evasive maneuver PAD.


CDR
Roger, And it's coming out.


CC
Roger. Out,


CDR
It's a haze. It's going by toward our minus-X direction, and several small particles are moving along with it. The actual velocity is fairly high - at least it appears to be high. And we've got an O2 high - it's a little high right now.


CC
Houston. Roger. Out.


00 03 53 05 CDR
And, Houston, you, might be interested that out my left-hand window right now, I can observe the entire continent of North America, Alaska, and over the Pole, down to the Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba, northern part of South America, and then I run out of window.


CC
Roger, We copy.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. All 12 latches are locked.







CC
Roger. 11, this is Houston. Understand 12 latches locked.


CC
11, Houston. Whenever you're possessed of a free moment there, we've got this evasive maneuver PAD.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.


LMP
All of a sudden there, we heard a little click, and the signal strength began to start dropping off. Your transmissions were cut off very abruptly. How do you read now?


CC
Roger. Loud and clear. We had a handover to Madrid about the time I was - I guess halfway through the PAD. If you could give me the last value you read, I'll pick up there. Over.


LMP
Okay. Start with DELTA-VZ. Over.


CC
Roger. DELTA-VZ is plus 00190, roll your option, pitch 213 357, and NOUN 44 is NA. DELTA-VT 00197 003 00152. The rest of the PAD is NA, and no ullage. LM weight 33,290. Read back. Over.

Sorry about that.

11, Houston. Your systems are looking good. We're standing by for the burn.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you confirm that pitch gimbal motor number 1 turned off? We just shut all four off, and we got a questionable indication on the ECS on pitch 1.


CC
Roger. Stand by a second.


CMP
Houston, did you copy our residuals?


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Stand by, please.


CMP
Go ahead, Houston. Did you copy our residuals?


CC
Roger. We got 00 and 0.2, it looks like.


CMP
We had 0.1 while ago. It's - just went to 0.2.


CC
Okay.


CDR
That EMS DELTA-V counter is minus 4.0.


CC
Minus 4.0. Roger.


CDR
And how about pitch gimbal 1? Can you confirm that OFF?


CC
Can you stand by just a second on that? At the present time we cannot confirm it OFF. We saw a current drop indicating that several gimbal motors had gone off. We'll be back with you in just a second on it. Over.


CDR
Okay, If necessary, we can recycle it.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you'll go ahead and cycle pitch gimbal motor number 1 on and then off and give us a Mark, and we'll tell you what we see. Over.

Okay, fine. It's coming back on. Ready.


CDR
MARK.


CDR
And it's going back off. Ready.


00 04 44 O6        CDR
MARK.


CDR
And that time we got an onboard indication, Houston. Thank you a lot.







CC
Roger. We confirm that it is OFF.


CDR
Yes. We do likewise.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We're starting our maneuver to observe the S IVB slingshot.


CC
Roger, 11. We've got an updated attitude for you on the slingshot observation.


CMP
Okay. Say the angles please.


CC
Roger. Roll 002.5, pitch 289.3, yaw 357.5, and there's also an update - minor correction to your attitude for the P52. Over.


CMP
Roger. I have roll 002.5, pitch 289.3, and yaw 357.5. Over.


CC
Roger. And for your P52 and optics calibration, it'll be roll 346.5, pitch 345.0, and yaw 007.8. Over.

Roger. We're going to go ahead and enable the S IVB for the slingshot maneuver. The LOX dump will start about 12 minutes from now. Over.


CMP
0kay, LOX dump about - I guess that'll make it about 01, huh?


CC
Right. I'll try to give you a little closer update as we approach it.


00 04 50 01 CMP
Alright.


CC
And, 11, for you information, the magnitude of midcourse correction number 1, if we burn, looks like about 17 feet per second. We're presently considering not burning it. This would make midcourse correction 2 tomorrow about 21.3. Over.


CDR
That sounds good to us.







CC
Roger. You're looking good down here.


CDR
Well, we didn't have much time, Houston, to talk to you about our views out the window when we were preparing for LM ejection; but up to that time, we had the entire northern part of the lighted hemisphere visible including North America, North Atlantic, and Europe and Northern Africa. We could see that the weather was good all - just about everywhere. There was one cyclonic depression in Northern Canada, in the Athabaska - probably east of Athabaska area. Greenland was clear, and it appeared to be we were seeing just the icecap in Greenland. All North Atlantic was pretty good; and Europe and Northern Africa seemed to be clear. Most of the United States was clear. There was a low - looked like a front stretching from the center of the country up across north of the Great Lakes and into Newfoundland.


CC
Roger. We copy.


CMP
I didn't know what I was looking at, but I sure did like it.


CC
Okay. I guess the view must be pretty good from up there. We show you just roughly somewhere around 19,000 miles out now.


CMP
I didn't have much outside my window.


CC
We'll get you into the PTC one of these days, and you take turns looking.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We've completed our maneuver to, observe the slingshot attitude, but we don't see anything - no Earth and no S IVB.


CC
Roger. Stand by. In GET I have a LOX dump start time for you. It's supposed to start at 5 plus 03 plus 07, and stop at 5 plus 04 plus 55. Ullage burn starts at 5 plus 37 plus 47, stops at 5 plus 42 plus 27. Over.


CMP
Roger. Thank you.


CC
11, Houston.


CDR
Go ahead, Houston.







CC
Roger. We now recommend the following attitude: roll 307.0, pitch 354.0, yaw 019.5, and the LOX dump has already been enabled, so we can't hold it off any longer.


CMP
That's okay. Go ahead. We'll maneuver around to 307, 354, and 19 and a half. Thank you sir.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. It doesn't look to us like you'll be able to make it around to this observation attitude in 2 minutes. We recommend that you save the fuel. Over.


CMP
Okay, Houston. You got to us just a little late. Our maneuver's already begun, so it's going to cost us about the same amount of fuel to stop it, no matter where we stop it, and we may as well keep going.


CC
Roger. Go ahead.


CC
11, Houston. LOX dump initiated.


CC
11, Houston. LOX dump has been terminated. Over.

Roger. If you'll give us ACCEPT and stay in P00, we'll set your trunnion bias to zero. And, I have a plan for balancing your oxygen CRYO's. Over.


CDR
You got it.


CC
Roger.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We've got the - what appears to be the S IVB in sight - at - oh, I'd estimate a couple of miles away. It's at our number 5 window and the dump appears to







be coming out of two radially opposite directions from the S IVB.


CC
Roger. They're continuing with the nonpropulsion vent from the liquid oxygen tank. It would be radially opposite, then. And boosters tell me it's the continuous vent system. They're also dumping a small amount of fuel at this time. We've got about 23-1/2 minutes or so until the APS burn. Over.


LMP
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. We have a recommended configuration for your CRY0 switches to even up the load between oxygen tanks 1 and 2. Over.


SC
...


CC
Okay. You're coming in very weakly there. We're recommending O2 tank 1 heater OFF, O2 tank 2 heater to AUTO, O2 tanks 1 and 2 fans both OFF, H2 tank 1 heaters to AUTO, and H2 tank 1 heaters to AUTO, and H2 tank 2 heaters to OFF. Over.


LMP
Roger. We have that except the last one was H2 fans to OFF. Is that affirmative?


CDR
We have - The configuration we have now is - Hydrogen heaters: we got 1 AUTO, 2 OFF. Oxygen heaters: 1 OFF, 2 AUTO. And we have all the fans OFF.


CC
This is Houston. Roger. We concur. Out.


CC
11, this is Houston. We've completed the trunnion zero bias setting. You can retrieve the computer and go to BLOCK.


CDR
Roger that. Thank you.


CC
11, this is Houston. With this maneuvering to observe the slingshot, I guess we missed copying your LM/CM DELTA-P reading. Over.

Stand by. We'll give you a ...







CC
Roger.


CMP
Right now, reading 0.2, Bruce.


CC
Roger. 0.2.

Okay, Mike. And could you verify that your waste compartment valve is in VENT, there?


CMP
Roger. Waste compartment valve has been in VENT for - oh, I guess, 45 minutes or so.


CC
Roger. We copy.


CMP
If we're late in answering you, it's because we're munching sandwiches.

I think today is also the birthday of California, and I believe they are 200 years old, and we send them a happy birthday. And I think it's Dr. Mueller's birthday, also, and I don't think he is that old.


CC
Roger. We copy. I'm looking back in the viewing room right now. I don't see him back there.


CDR
He may not be back from the Cape yet.

Coming on right now.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Did you copy our torquing angles?


CC
Roger. Leave them on there probably a second, please.


CMP
Will do.

11, this is Houston. We copy the angles, but stand by before you go ahead and use them. Over.


CMP
Standing by.


CC
11, Houston. We request that you read P52, and if the angles come out the same magnitude, go ahead and incorporate them. Over.


CMP
Okay. We'll do that.


CC
They look a little large right now.


CMP
Yes. Roll - roll locks a little large, especially, there.


CC
Roger.


CC
We're showing a waste-water quantity of about 13 percent on TM now, 11. Over.


CMP
Roger. It's off, now







 CC
Roger. We copy.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Torquing angles essentially the same, and we're going to go ahead and torque them now.


CC
Roger. We concur.


CMP
Okay.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Could you give us a - an AUTO optics check to a third star or a different star from the one you've been using?


CMP
Sure, be glad to. I can go back and do the whole thing and pick different stars.


CC
I don't think there - there's any need to do that. We'd just like to confirm it with a different star, since that roll angle was a little larger than we expected.


CMP
Okay.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. I have a TLI-plus-11-hour PAD when you're ready to copy.


LMP
Wait one.

Roger. Do you have any update for the roll, pitch and yaw angles on the top of page 37 in the flight plan. Or are they still good?







CC
That's for the optics calibration?


CDR
Yes, sir.


CC
Yes, indeed. I'll give them to you in just a second here.


CC
Roger, 11. For the optics calibration I've got 346.5 for roll, 345.0 for pitch, and 007.8 for yaw. The pen-and-ink attitude corrections in your book for P23 are good. Over.

Hey Charlie.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Go ahead, 11. Over.


LMP
Hey, maybe you better call Lou and tell him we might be a little bit late for dinner.

Okay. Sure will. We'd like for you to turn on - the fan on in O2 tank number 2, Buzz. And, 11, did you - on your optics calibrations, did you proceed or recall the program? Over.


LMP
We recalled the program.


CC
Roger.


LMP
And O2 fan number 2 is on.


CC
Roger.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. I've got a CRY0 pressure light and a MASTER ALARM. It's reset.


CC
Roger. We expected that. That's why we had you turn the fan on. We were getting pretty







close to the caution and warning limits. We were trying to prevent that.


LMP
Okay.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Go ahead, 11. Over.


CMP
Roger. You're looking at our DELTA-R DELTA-V. It looks like DELTA-R is pretty large, there. We wanted to talk to you about it before we incorporate it.


CC
Stand by, Mike. We don't have anything on our downlink here, I don't think, on the DSKY. Stand by.


CMP
Okay. Our NOUN 49 is reading: register 1, plus 08793; register 2, all balls.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to reject the NOUN 49 stuff on the DSKY right now, Mike, and try it again. Over.


CMP
Okay. Will do.


CMP
Okay, Houston. Apollo 11. Here's another 49 for you. Are you getting it on the downlink?


CC
Roger. We see it. Stand by.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49 display on the DSKY now. Over.


CMP
Okay. It looks like an awful big one. We noticed that you'd moved star number 2 to the







tail end of the listing, and we should be marking first on star 40. Did that have anything to do with it?


CC
Negative. We don't believe so, Apollo 11. We think that this is possibly due to some TLI dispersions, and it's probably satisfactory. So go ahead and accept this. It fits our criteria anyway that if you repeat the mark and you get an equivalent size to go ahead and accept it. And this is an equivalent size error. Over.


CMP
Okay. We'll do it.


CC
And 11, Houston. Your state vector in the LM slots are - is good. Over.


CMP
Roger. Thank you.

LMP
Roger. Why don't you sing out when you think we've done enough battery charging on B.







CC
Roger. Stand by, Buzz. Over.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'll be charging battery B up until the sleep period. We'll discontinue charging at that time. Also, at about 12 25 in the flight plan, we have battery A charge. That has been deleted. Over.


LMP
Roger. Understand. We'll charge until the sleep period on B and delete the battery A charge.


CC
Affirmative.


CMP
And, Houston, Apollo 11. These AUTO optics maneuvers or P23's, AUTO maneuvers, don't seem to be going to the substellar point. Can you come up with the roll, pitch, and yaw angle for the substellar point on this star? It's our second star.


CC
Roger. Stand by.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Your angles in the flight plan we feel are still good, 198.6 130.7, 340.0. Just slightly off than those in the flight plan. Over.


CMP
Okay. We'll try that.


CMP
Charlie, state those three angles one more time. I'd like to confirm them before I maneuver.


CC
Roger. Roll and pitch are slightly off than what's in the flight plan, 11. Roll is now 198.6, pitch is 1307. Over.


CMP
Roger. Roll 198.6, pitch 130.7, and yaw 34000.


CC
That's affirmative.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. I think the problem here is that that attitude just is not too close to the substellar point. I'm having to maneuver quite a bit; and that's in progress now, so stand by for some marks.


CC
Roger. We copy it all.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've run the angles given in the flight plan for the P23







attitude through the machines down here, and they come up the same thing every time. We think everything's going correctly, Mike, and we're wondering if the nonsymmetrical horizon might by giving a problem. Over.


00 07 09 51 CMP
Yes, I'd say - It could be, Charlie. Stand by here. We'll get another mark for you.


CC
Okay.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. NOUN 49 for you.


CC
Roger. Copy.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49. Continue through your sequence of sightings, and then we'll analyze the data afterwards. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Star 40 has just disappeared now in the sextant. Could the trunnion angle 47 - something be a little high?


CC
Stand by.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to press on to star 44. Over.


CMP
Yes. Roger. All right. How many marks have you recorded on star 40?


CC
Stand by, Mike.


CMP
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. We copied two good marks. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Go ahead. Over.


CMP
Roger. Forty-four is just not bright enough for this. There's a reddish glow filling the black area of the sextant, and the star is lost somewhere in there, and I cannot see it.







CC
Roger. Stand by. We'll come up with another star. Over.


CMP
Yes. I'd appreciate that.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to go on to star 45. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CC
And, Mike, we think these large DELTA-R's, NOUN 49, you're getting is really meaningful since it's been way before TLI since we had a state vector update; and we think it's normal. Over.


CMP
Okay. Could be, Charlie. Some of the early markings, I might not have had precisely the substellar point. I think as time goes by they've been coming more accurate but old Enif here is just flat invisible.


CC
Roger.


CMP
And, Houston, Apollo 11. Understand that the same three gimbal angles you gave me should be valid for star 45 as well. Is that affirmative?


CC
I'm believe that's right. Stand by one. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CC
That is negative. Stand by one.


CMP
Okay. Because there's quite a difference between the gimbal angles you have and the gimbal angles the program wants, but with inaccurate state vector, I'm inclined not to believe the program.


CC
Stand by.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11.LMP is back on the line.


CC
Roger. Copy.


LMP
Read you five-by.


CC
Roger. Same, Buzz. And, 11, the angles for you are 1978 for roll, 1285 pitch, 3400 yaw.







CMP
Okay. Just as a matter of comparison, P23 for this star would like to go to 235.66, 154.31, and 31365. Over.


CC
Roger. We copy, 11. We understand that the program can give you almost an infinite combination of angles in P23, and it's not too unreasonable. If you'll stand by, we'll look at these that we see on the DSKY. Over.


CMP
Okay. Then in the meantime I'll just go ahead and maneuver to yours. 197.8, 128.5, and 340.0.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Go ahead. Over.


CMP
Okay, Charlie. If the attitude you gave me on star number 45 - The reticle is off, I'd say, a good 30 degrees in roll, and the star is not in sight. Over.


CC
Roger. Stand by.


CMP
I think something's wrong with those attitudes.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I wondered if you have AUTO optics selected. Over.

That's affirmative.


CC
Roger. Looks like to us we need a PROCEED, Mike, to get the sextant pointed at the star. Over.


CMP
Okay. Stand by.


CC
11, Houston. Those shaft and trunnion angles were exactly what we were computing on the ground. Over.


CMP
Okay. I'm going to trim up the attitude here and give it another try.

Okay. I have this star loud and clear now, Charlie, so I might as well do a bunch of marks on this one to get a good horizon count.


CC
Roger. Stand by.


CMP
It still looks like I'm far from the substellar point. However, I'm off quite a hit in roll.


CC
Roger. We'd like you to mark right where it is now, Mike, and we'd like two sets of marks on this. Over.


CMP
Okay. Fine. But the reticle is not parallel to the horizon. I'd have to move off quite a hit in order to get it parallel to that.


CC

Negative.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Okay, Charlie. I'll be glad to give you as many of these as you like.


CC
Roger. We'd like six marks on star 45, Mike, and then we'll probably go back to star 2 again. Stand by. We'll have further word on that.

Stand by.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to go back to star number 2 with an attitude as follows: roll 1952, pitch 1239, yaw 3400. Mike, that'll give you a trunnion angle of about 31.4. Over.


CMP
Okay. I understand star number 2 and roll 195.2, itch 123.9, and yaw 340.0. Over.


CC
That's affirmative.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Okay, Charlie. I'm there, and I've got a trunnion angle of 30.5 degrees. Again, misaligned considerably in roll and I do believe that's important to getting good marks.


CC
Stand by.







CMP
See, if my reticle's not parallel, then I'm not marking normal to the horizon and I'm not marking at the substellar point. I'm marking off somewhere else.


CC
Stand by one. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. The ground-computed values for your shaft and trunnion are just what you're getting on the DSKY there, Mike.

CMP
Okay, Charlie. It just appears to me that you have to have a reticle tangent to the horizon at the point at which you mark or else you're not at the substellar point; you're off laterally, and therefore you're measuring a larger trunnion angle than you should.


CC
Seems so to me. Our procedures people are working on this, and we'll be back with you momentarily. Over.


CMP
Thank you, sir.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you read, this attitude 000 is pretty bad for our COMM. In fact, we've lost all data with you, and unreadable on the voice. We recommend you do the P52, option 1 preferred ...


CMP
... not a very good attitude at all for COMM, and as soon as we finish our alignment, we'll maneuver it to a different attitude. Over.

We also noted some funny indications when you closed the waste stowage vent valve. We're going to continue to take a look at this through the night, and we'll be with you in the morning with an assessment of the problem.

It's working good so far, Charlie. We've got one installed on the water gun and the other one installed on the spigot down in the LEB, and we - mention one problem with them is that they leak at the junction between the food bag and the water filter. However, with that exception, they seem to be working pretty good. We were getting some gas through initially, and I think that was just getting the system purged out to begin with; and the last tubeful we poured was almost free of bubbles. Over.

Okay, 11. This is Houston. At time approximately 22 30 in the flight plan, in your postsleep checklist, and in all other postsleep checklists, we'd like you to delete the statement that says "AUTO RCS JET SELECT, 16 to ON," and what we're doing here is picking this up in the procedure for exiting PTC that's in your CSM checklist.

Okay. Right now it reads, "To exit G&amp;N PTC," then you've got a pen-and-ink change that says, "AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A and B." And you come down to the printed step 1. We'd like to take and move the "AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A and B" down to be the second step, so the procedure would read, "Step 1, MANUAL ATTITUDE 3, ACCEL COMMAND; Step 2 AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A B." Step 3 would be, "Verify DAP load," and so on. Over.


LMP
Roger. I copy. Is that AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A, MAIN B to be the ...


CC
Roger. It should be the second step in that procedure. At time 22 40, or when you get to it, we'd like to commence a charge on battery A. And at time 24 10, we have an updated attitude for your P52 and optics calibration. Over.

Seemed to me yesterday when we were doing this on battery C, it started out initially, and it went lower, the battery charge holder. Over.


CC
Roger. Stand by a second, and I'll get some reading on that.


CMP
On charging battery A: now, it's at about 393 and - oh, about 1.5 amps. Looks like it's gradually increasing in the ...


CC
Roger. On our CM,.we're showing you at 39.11, and your current's about what you reported.


CMP
Okay. I guess you're happy, then.


CC
I think we're losing you in the noise again, 11. Stand by.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.


00 23 l0 41        CC
Roger, 11. On your battery charging question, we feel that it's probably a difference between individual batteries; and it does seem to have gone away as sort of a startup transient here. Other factors that might conceivably have an influence on it would be battery temperature, things of this sort. EECOMM seems to feel that it's operating within the normal design limits. Over.


CMP
All right. Very good. Thank you.


CC
Okay.







CC
11, this is Houston. If you are interested in the morning news, I have a summary here from PAO. Over.


CDR
Okay. We're all listening.


CC
Okay. From Jodrell Bank, England, via AP: Britain's big Jodrell Bank radio telescope stopped receiving signals from the Soviet Union's unmanned Moon shot at 5:49 EDT today. A spokesman said that it appeared the Luna 15 space ship "had gone beyond the Moon." Another Quote: "We don't think it has landed," said a spokesman for Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of the Observatory. Washington UPI: Vice President Spiro T. Agnew has called for putting a man on Mars by the year 2000, but Democratic leaders replied that priority must go to needs on Earth. Agnew, ranking government official at the Apollo 11 blastoff Wednesday, apparently was speaking for himself and not necessarily for the Nixon administration when he said, "We should, in my judgment, put a man on Mars by the end of this century." Laredo, Texas, AP: Immigration officials in Nuevo Laredo announced Wednesday that hippies will be refused tourist cards to enter Mexico unless they take a bath and get haircuts. Huberto Cazaras, Chief of Mexican Immigration in Nuevo Laredo, said authorities in Mexico City, Acapulco, and other popular tourist spots have registered complaints about the hippies. By United Press International: Initial reaction to President Nixon's granting of a holiday Monday to Federal employees so they can observe a national day of participation in the Apollo 11 Moon landing mission mostly was one of surprise. Rodney Bidner, Associated Press, London AP: Europe is Moon struck by the Apollo 11 mission. Newspapers throughout the continent fill their pages with pictures of the Saturn V rocket blasting off to forge Earth's first link with its natural satellite. And the headline writers taxed their imagination for words to hail the feat. "The greatest adventure in the history of humanity has started," declared the French newspaper Le Figaro, which devoted four pages to reports from Cape Kennedy and diagrams of the mission. The tabloid Paris Jour proclaimed, "The whole word tells them bravo." The Communists daily L'Humanite led with the launch picture and devoted its entire back page to an enthusiastic Moon report describing the countdown and launch, the astronauts' wives and families, and backgrounding lunar activities.







Hempstead, New York: Joe Namath officially reported to the New York Jets training camp at Hofstra University Wednesday following a closed door meeting with his teammates over his differences with pro football Commissioner Peter Rozelle. London UPI: The House of Lords was assured Wednesday that a midget American submarine would not "damage or assault" the Loch Ness monster. Lord Nomay said he wanted to be sure anyone operating a submarine in the Loch "would not subject any creatures that might inhabit it to damage or assault." He asked that the submarine's plan to take a tissue sample with a retrievable dart from any monster it finds can be done without damage and disturbance. He was told it was impossible to say if the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act would be violated unless and until the monster found. Over.


CDR
Roger. Thank you, Bruce. Another thing on that number 2 item, we all ... before we left, and we hope we get a chance to see him another time. Over.


CC
Roger. And I understand he was down there and really enjoyed watching the launch. We all think it was pretty magnificent, and you all are doing great job up there.

Thank you.

APOLLO 11 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION




CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


CDR
Roger. Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. Mike, we've got some comments on performance of P23 for today if you've got a minute to talk.


CDR
He's all ears.


CMP
Yes. Go ahead.


CC
Okay. For today, we'd like you on P23 to make a trunnion bias determination, prior to P23 sightings as called out in procedures, and also one afterwards. Our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular read-out in the sextant. The bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated, that is a PROCEED on NOUN 87 after you get two consecutive measurements equal to within 0.003 degrees. And, of course, move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements. The Earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today. I'm , sure you're a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are, but to ensure that you're getting a good angle measurement between the star and the Earth horizon, the sextant M-line, which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the R-line, should be parallel to the Earth horizon at the substellar point. And then the actual superimposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant: above, below, or on the M-line. We recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after AUTO maneuver. If you feel that the amount of time between the AUTO maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive, or that you don't like that AUTO maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark, of course, you can use a VERB 94 - VERB 94 to get you back to the flashing 51 position to redo the AUTO maneuvers. Over.


CMP
Roger. Stand by one. We're going to stop PTC, and then we'll talk about this P23.


CC
Okay.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11.







CC
Go ahead, 11.


CMP
Okay. We're stopping PTC now and maneuvering to our P52 and optics CAL attitude. In regard to that P23, what I was trying to tell you yesterday was about that. The M-line is not anywhere parallel to the horizon at the roll, pitch, and yaw which you gave me to go to for the substellar point, and I was trying to maneuver off to get it parallel to the horizon when you all said that was not necessary.


CC
Roger, 11. I guess in keeping the cups of coffee score, why you get that one.


CMP
Well - Okay - Well, this morning, let's just see how close it comes to being parallel to the M-line. Before we started marking for the first time, it appeared that the computation of - of those three angles was somewhat off, and that I was wasting a lot of gas by going to those three angles and then having to make large attitude changes after that to get the M-line parallel. In some cases it appeared to be just an accepted attitude required, and you all said that it wasn't needed. So I was marking in some cases with the M-line not parallel. I thought perhaps you had some processor for computing that offset and making sense out of that data, but as far as I know, we've got to have the M-line parallel to the horizon.


CC
Roger, 11. We don't have that capability. We do require that the M-line be parallel to the horizon in order to get a good mark. We feel that possibly the - the state vector information that you were using for your maneuver basis yesterday may have needed to be updated a little. And if you'll standby a second, we'll give you an evaluation of what we feel you'll get today by the AUTO maneuver.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.


CC
Go ahead, 11.


CMP
Roger. I'm getting ready to do an O2 Fuel cell purge. Do you have any particulars on this? And I assume you want these one at a time, or can I triple up? Over.







CC
We'd like them one at a time, and stand by. I don't think we have any sequence. You can do them in any order you want.


CMP
Okay.


CC
And we're watching you on TM down here.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. You want to look at these NOUN 93's before I proceed on?


CC
Yes, please. Stand by a second.


CMP
Okay.


CC
11, this is Houston. On our TM, here, we're only seeing values in two registers. Can you read us out the contents of register 3, please?


CMP
Register 3: minus three balls 24.


CC
Roger. Minus three balls 24. And you can go ahead and proceed.


CMP
Okay. Proceeding at this time.


CC
11, Houston. After you've completed P52, we'd like to uplink you a new state vector so we can start out clean on this P23. Over.


CDR
Okay.


CMP
Houston, are you observing the higher O2 flow on fuel cell 3?


CDR
Houston, Apollo 11. It's triggered the MASTER ALARM three times, now. There goes number 4. It goes up to about 1.4, then oscillates back down to about 1.1. Over.


CC
Roger. We saw them 1.3 now on TM. Stand by a second.


CMP
And we're in P00, now, for a state vector.


CC
Roger. Give us ACCEPT, please.


CMP
Roger. Done.


CC
11, Houston. On your O2 flow, fuel cell 3: apparently it was flowing a little higher than the other two during purge, but the flow rate is acceptable. Over.







CMP
Roger, It seems to be flowing a little bit more, and actually putting out more current than the other two, also. Over.


CC
Roger. We copy.


CC
11, this is Houston. We've completed the uplink; the computer is yours; you can go back to BLOCK.


CMP
Okay. Thank you.


CC
Go ahead, 11.


CDR
Houston, 11. I don't believe we were calling you right then,


CC
Roger. Out.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.


CMP
Roger. I'm in a good attitude here to do - I have in the sextant this last P52 star, star 37. Is that all right for the optics calibration to save some gas, or do you want to go over to star 40?


CC
Star 37 will be fine for the optics calibration. And we haven't noticed a VERB 66, yet, after our state vector uplink. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CC
When you move into P23, we recommend that you use the CMC-computed angles for your AUTO maneuver and see how that works out. If it doesn't bring you up with the M-line parallel to the horizon to the substellar point, we will see if we can get you some ground-computed angles. I guess the big thing here is to make sure that the M-line is parallel to substellar points so we can get a good angular measurement. Over.


CMP
Yes. I believe.


CC
Roger. Over.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Marking on this star, I get a NOUN 87 twice in a row of five balls, so that's sufficient for a count.


CC
That's certainly very sufficient.







CMP
Okay. Now I want to go to P00, and I am going to take your three angles and do a verify of 49 maneuver to your substellar point. Okay?


CC
Okay. We recommend that for the first star, if we gave you a new state vector, we'd like to try the CMC-computed angles for your AUTO maneuver.


CMP
Okay.


CC
And have you hit PROCEED on this display to enter the zero?


CMP
Not yet.


CC
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. Over the past 2 hours we have seen a slight continuing increase in partial pressure Of CO2. Have you in fact changed the CO2 canister yet this morning? We don't need to do it right now; we'd just like to confirm it on our instrumentation - is in good shape. Over.


CMP
No. We haven't changed any canisters this morning.


CC
Okay. Then you can plan on accomplishing that after P23 is over and you've got the LEB clear.


CMP
All right.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We're in process of maneuvering to P23 in desired attitude. It likes roll 8.37, pitch 61.33, and yaw 339.87. Over.


CC
Roger. We copy. And that is for star 01?


CMP
Star 01, right near the horizon. Code 110.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. On this star, the AUTO maneuver works just fine. I am right at the substellar point. Everything looks beautiful except there is no star in sight. It is just not visible.


CC
Roger. Is this for star 01?


CMP
That's correct.







CC
You are not getting any reflections or anything like that that would obscure your vision, are you?


CMP
Well, of course, the Earth is pretty bright, and the black sky, instead of being black, has sort of a rosy glow to it. The star, unless it is a very bright one, is probably lost somewhere in that glow, but it is just not visible. I maneuvered the reticle considerably above the horizon to make sure that the star is not lost in the brightness below the horizon. However, even when I get the reticle considerably above the horizon so the star should be seen against the black background, it still is not visible.


CC
Roger. We copy. Standby a minute, please.


CC
11, this is Houston. Can you read us the shaft and trunnion angle off the counters?


CMP
Yes. I will be glad to. Shaft 331.2 and trunnion 35.85.


CC
Roger. Thank you.


CMP
It's really a fantastic sight through that sextant. A minute ago, during that AUTO maneuver, the reticle swept across the Mediterranean. You could see all of North Africa, absolutely clear; all of Portugal, Spain, southern France; all of Italy, absolutely clear. Just a beautiful sight.


CC
Roger. We all envy you the view up there.


CMP
But still no star.


CC
11, this is Houston. Over.


CMP
Roger. Go ahead, Bruce.


CC
On our ground computers we confirm the shaft and trunnion angle that you have as being pointed at the star. However, it looks as though that shaft and trunnion angle is also pointing into the structure of the LM, so that while you will be getting the Earth's horizon, the star ... is obscured by the LM. We recommend an AUTO maneuver to the attitudes pen-and-inked into the flight plan. Roll 1772, pitch 2982 and yaw 330.0. Over.







CMP
Okay. Fine. Let ts try that.

Roger.


CMP
I'm going to hold right here for your next suggestion.

Go ahead.


CC
Yes, Mike. We show you in VERB 59 right now. Over.


CMP
That's right. I - I haven't entered - I gave the - I gave it back to the computer for a second. I put the mode switch from MANUAL back to CMC while I fooled with the DSKY, and the computer drove the star off out of sight. So the delay here has been in going back to MANUAL and finding the star again, which I've finally done. And - Just a second here, I'll go to ENTER and get a 51 and mark on it. As I say, for some reason the computer drove the star off out of sight.

Hey, Jim, I'm looking through the monocular now, and to coin an expression, the view is just beautiful. It's out of this world. I can see all the islands in the Mediterranean. Some larger and smaller islands of Majorca, Sardinia, and Corsica.







A little haze over the upper Italian peninsula, some cumulus clouds out over Greece. The Sun is setting on the eastern Mediterranean now. The British Isles are definitely greener in color than the brownish green that we have in the islands, in the peninsula of Spain. Over.

Roger. I understand that the Northern Africa - Mediterranean area is fairly clear today, huh?


LMP
Right.

Yes. We see a bunch of roads with cars driving up and down, too.


CC
Do you find that the monocular is any good to you, Buzz?


LMP
Yes, It would be nicer if it had another order of magnitude of power on it. Of course, it has a tendency to jiggle around a little bit, and you might want to have some sort of a bracket. I hate to use that word though.


LMP
Got an anticyclone going in the southern hemisphere southeast of Brazil, and some - Well, the diameter of it must be over 2000 miles across.

How does the weather look up in the southern part of the western hemisphere, or up in the United States area?


LMP
Well, you all are just beginning to come over the limb now. I can see parts of Central America, and it looks to be fairly clear there. The islands in the Caribbean are beginning to come in and rather a few streaming lines of clouds. Looks like there is a system up to the - well, off of Greenland that has some large cloud streamers extending back down to the southwest. The east coast of the U.S. is just coming into view now, and it doesn't look too bad that I can see right now. We may have some pretty good shots later on this afternoon. Over.

In general, the color of the oceans is mostly uniform and it's bright and darker blue except for that region that's about one-eighth of an Earth's radius in diameter; and in this circular area, the blue of the water turns a grayish color, and I'm sure that's where the Sun's rays are being reflected back on up toward us. Over.


CC
Roger, Buzz. We noticed the same thing. It's very similar to looking at a light shining on something like a billiard ball or a bowling ball. You get this bright spot in the blue of the water, and that turns it to sort of a grayish color.


LMP
Yes. Is there a Navy term for that?


CC
(Laughing.) A lot of gray paint.


CC
11, Houston.


CMP
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Mike, are you satisfied with P23 now?


CMP
Yes, I'm happy with the last updates we got, you know, in terms of what it did to our state vector. Still not altogether happy with the various procedures. If we could pick stars within the smaller range of trunnion angles so that you could allow P23 to pick its own maneuver and go to that substellar point and then have that star visible, that would seem to me to be the simplest and best way to do it.


CC
How about the - -


LMP
... correction on that last ...


CC
How about the horizon now? Is it pretty well defined for you and no longer hazy?


CMP
Yes. We're far enough out now that the - I think the horizon definition variation is lost in the North.


LMP
Hey, Jim.


CC
Go ahead, Buzz.







LMP
Looks like the best way to get a steady view through the monocular is just steady it out and let it close when it's in front of your eye, and then you kind of float up next to it so that you're not touching it at all. It has a very slow drift, and you get a better - steadier view that way.


CC
Sounds good.


CC
How does it feel to be airborne again, Buzz?


LMP
Well, I'll tell you, I've been having a ball floating around inside here, back and forth up to one place and back to another. It's like being outside, except more comfortable.


CC
It's a lot bigger than our last vehicle.


CMP
... kept me busy, I'm ...


CMP
Say again about Buzz -


LMP
Yes. It sure is nice in here.


CC
I said it's a lot bigger than the last vehicle that Buzz and I were in.


CMP
Oh, yes. It's been nice. I've been very busy so far. I'm looking forward to taking the afternoon off. I've been cooking, and sweeping, and almost sewing, and you know, the usual little housekeeping things.


CC
It was very convenient the way they put the food preparation system right next to the NAV station.


CDR
Everything is right next to everything in this vehicle.


LMP
Not if you're in the ...


CDR
Jim, it's been a little warm in the machine throughout yesterday and last night during the PTC. It cooled off somewhat with the windows buttoned up, and we've seen suit temperatures of about - the high 40's and cabin temperatures in the low 60's. But this seems to be still a little bit on the warm side.


CC
I understand that it got a little warm during the day and cooled down a little bit when you put the shades up, but you're still a little bit warm. Do you have any moisture condensation or anything like that on the wall?







CDR
No, we haven't been able to detect any moisture anyplace in the spacecraft. It seems to be fine.


LMP
One of the hydrogen filters - the one that we've got on the hot water - seems to keep flowing when you remove one of the food bags from it. Its flow rate is quite small, right near the end of one out, and that contributes a little bit of moisture to the atmosphere.


CMP
Yes, that hydrogen thing, it's - I'm not sure, but I think it's a backpressure problem. If the thing sees any backpressure at all, like when the bag is attached, well the flow rate will slowly decrease to where it's almost zero, and you wait, and you wait, and you wait for that last ounce. You think you have its and you remove the bag, and then you very rapidly thereafter see maybe a glob the size of a dime or a quarter come out and just hang there. That appears to be true even though the opening into the bag is not restricted.


CC
Understand.


LMP
In general, I think they do quite a good job, especially on the guns, in removing a lot of the hydrogen bubbles.


CC
Have the water temperatures been good? Are you getting hot water?


LMP
Yes. It seems reasonably warm.


CMP
We made three cups of coffee today. The last one - you know when all the plumbing was warmed up, the hydrogen gun and everything, was warmest of the three. I don't know who had that one - Neil, did you have that one? How was your coffee? You didn't drink it till later, did you? Anyway, it's pretty good. It's not piping hot, but it sure beats stone-cold coffee.


CMP
Jim, we've been sitting here a little over 20 minutes now, How does the thruster firing activity look? Are you ready to go on with this PTC?


CC
Roger. Stand by.


CC
We're all set to go, Mike.


CMP
Okay. I'll press on then.







CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. PTC has started and it looks good.


CC
11, Roger. This is Houston. Roger. Out.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


CDR
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. If you're free for a couple of minutes, we have a procedure here that will let us verify the O2 flow transducer and at the same time get some more of our cabin enrichment out of the way. Over.


CDR
Stand by.


CDR
Go ahead, Houston. We're ready to copy.


CC
Roger. The primary purpose of this is, as I mentioned, to let us check out your O2 flow transducer. However, we still need about 2 hours' worth of cabin enrichment, so we'd like to keep the vent that we're going to set up going for this purpose. Okay. We want you to install the cabin vent quick disconnect which you'll find in compartment R-6, that is Romeo 6, on the urine connector on panel 251. When this is completed, verify that the waste stowage vent valve is closed, and then open or position the waste management overboard drain to the DUMP position. Over.


CDR
Okay. Understand that. Install the cabin quick disconnect out of R-6 on the 251 urine connector and verify that the waste dump valve is closed, and say again the last part.


CC
Roger. And then put the waste management overboard drain valve into the DUMP position. Over.


CDR
Roger. Put the waste management overboard drain valve to the DUMP position.


CC
Right. That's the one down on panel 251 also. And we'll watch your O2 flow on telemetry down here.


CDR
Okay, Houston. That configuration is set up.


CC
11, this is Houston. Say again, please.







CDR
You do have the O2 flow transducer checkout setup accomplished.


CC
Okay. Understand you have opened the drain valve at this time.


CDR
That's ... It's in DUMP.


CC
Roger. We're not getting telemetry data from you right due to low signal strength. There it comes back. I expect it'll probably take us anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour to see an increase in O2 flow due to the size of the cabin and of course of the small size of the drain. Over.


CDR
Roger.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Go ahead, 11.


CMP
Roger. I've got the world in my window for a change and looking at it through the monocular, it's really something. I wish I could describe it properly. The weather is very good. South America is coming around into view. I can see on the - what appears to me to be upper horizon, a point that must be just about Seattle, Washington, and from there I can see all the way down to the southern tip of Tierra del Fuego and the southern tip of the continent.


CC
Roger. Sounds like you've got a beautiful view up there.


CMP
Absolutely fantastic. I hope the pictures come out. We,re rotating around where it's going out of view again.


LMP
I'm waiting to pick it up in the sextant.


CC
Sounds like one of these rotating restaurants.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Do you need some help keeping OMNI's locked on us?


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Negative. We had a command computer at the Madrid site go down. We had to switch over to Ascension temporarily. We're now back remoting through Madrid, and the computer is back, and we're ready to resume control of your OMNI's and full communication. Over.


LMP
Okay. You've got it.


CC
Okay. One thing that we did miss in the dropout in the noise here is your LM/CM DELTA-P reading for about 28 hours GET. Over.


LMP
Okay. The LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.98.


CC
Roger. 0.98, and what have you been reading for O2 flow on your onboard gage? Over.


LMP
Well, right now, after we put that gadget in, we've got it back to 0.35. Before that, we were reading on scale level. I think ours is relatively correct, at least when time comes for the water accumulator to kick in at 10 seconds, it goes on up to about 0.75, 0.8, something like that.


CC
This is Houston. Roger. Out.


CC
And, 11, this is Houston. A little more information based on our analysis of your last SPS burn: it looks like you got a good solid burn there. We show 94 psi chamber pressure and it looks like the SPS is definitely GO. Over.


LMP
Good to heer it.


CC
Roger. We thought you'd feel that way about it.


LMP
We're right in the middle of - well either ... or salmon salad, or something like that. That's probably why we're not answering you right away.

Okay. Well, we don't want - -


LMP
My compliments to the chef, that salad salmon is outstanding.







CC
Roger. Understand that's the salad salmon. Over.


LMP
Something like that, salmon salad.


CC
There we go, the salmon salad, very good.


LMP
Okay. Bruce, we're coming up on the water accumulator activity, and it's going on up to 0.85, oh, about 0.95 and it reached a peak there and then gradually dropped back on down to 0.6 now, 0.4, and it looks like it's pretty well - pretty well leveling off back down to 0.35. Over.


CC
Roger, We're copying that.


CC
11, Houston.


CDR
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. On that 2O flow transducer down here on telemetry, our values are agreeing pretty well with what you read out onboard, and the EECOMM's have been noticing this cycle, but it still looks like the indicated rate is lower than what we would expect. We're still working on the problem, and we'll let you have a more complete diagnosis on it in a little while.


CDR
Okay. It's a tight fix then.


CMP
We run a tight ship.

CMP
Buzz in singing.

Okay.

Pass me the sausage, man.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


CDR
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger, 11. We've been watching your activity on the DSKY there, and by selecting another major program with a VERB 37 ENTER and all that, we show you collapsing the deadband in PTC and having driven the CMC rate from 0.3 degrees per second down to 0 degrees per second, although of course, with all the AUTO RCS coils shut off, you're not firing any thrusters. 0ver.







CDR
Okay. What do you recommend?


CC
Well, you can just continue in your present configuration in PTC. However, if you go to turn any thrusters on, the CMC would then try to bring you into an attitude hold position rather than continuing with the PTC. Over.


CDR
Roger. I understand.


CC
Okay.


CDR
And, Houston, we're just looking at you out our window here. Looks like there's a circulation of clouds that just moved east of Houston over the Gulf and Florida area. Did that have any rain in it this morning?


CC
Roger. Our report from outside says that it's raining out here, and looks like you've got a pretty good eye for the weather there.


CDR
Yes. Well, it looks like it ought to clear up pretty soon from our viewpoint. The western edge of the weather isn't wery far west of you.


CC
Okay.

CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


CDR
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
11, this is Houston. As a result of our venting through the waste management drain, we've concluded that your O2 flow rate sensor is, in fact, malfunctioning. I mentioned when you talked us through the cyclic water accumulator dump that even though it was moving, probably indicating a higher flow rate, it didn't seem to be indicating a flow rate that is high enough; and based on that and the flow that we're getting right now, we've concluded that the transducer is malfunctioning. We'd like to continue the O2 flow for about another hour, shutting it off at about 31 hours GET, to get the O2 concentration in the vehicles up to - in the vehicles up to where it will be acceptable for LM checkout. Over.


CDR
Okay. Does it look to you like it just has a bias on it?


CC
Roger, 11. It does seem to be a bias. Looks like it has a fairly high threshold before it starts indicating. EECOMM seems to think, though, that for high flow rate purposes, it will still give you a relative indication during the mission. Over.


CDR
Okay. We understand. Thank you.

Okay, that's - Roger. That's both the numbers on the DSKY itself, and the little words like PROGRAM and VERB, NOUN, COMPUTER ACTIVITY, things of this sort?


CT
Roger. I can read the numbers clearly. We can't distinguish what the words are, because it is a little snowy.


CC
Roger.


CT
Okay. I read VERB, NOUN, and PROGRAM.


CC
Roger. Do you see - Over in the lefthand corner, there's a big square one that says COMPUTER ACTIVITY, COMP ACTIVITY?

Roger. I see a flash occasionally in that area.


CC
Roger. that's the one.

Okay. It looks like he's moved the camera at this time.

Well, they will spring into action here momentarily. Stand by.

Hello, 11. We see your heart beating.

Okay, Well - look at the CDR's and the CMP's and see if they go up any. We're all running in place up here. You wouldn't believe it.


CC
I'd like to see that sight. Why don't you give us a TV picture of that one.


CMP
I think Buzz is trying. You got it.


CC
Okay. It's coming in at Goldstone, Buzz. As Bruce, said, we don't have it here in the center.


CMP
I'm afraid this isn't going to help out the PTC very much.


CMP
Yes. I don't know if it's a vibration or what it is, but it makes the pitch and yaw rate needles on FDAI number 1 jump up and down a little bit where we jump up and down.

0kay.

We've got a tittle distortion in the horizontal direction from banding on our monitor. I wonder if they're getting the same thing?

Stand by, Buzz. I'll let you know.


LMP
I guess it would be more described as a waviness.

Goldstone M&amp;O.

Okay. The crew is complaining of some horizontal banding on their monitor. Do you see that on the picture?

I guess when we're showing the DSKY or when we're showing the Earth might be the better time.


CC
Okay.


CT
Houston CAP COMM, Goldstone.


CC
Go ahead.


CT
Okay. Our TV people confirm they see this horizontal band.


CC
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. The Goldstone TV people also see the banding when - at the same time you do. Over.







LMP
Okay. Would they call it a horizontal waviness, instead of banding, maybe?


CC
I'm not talking to them directly. Stand by, Buzz. Let me see how they describe it.


CC
Goldstone M&amp;0, Houston CAP COMM. Could you put the TV guy on the loop, please?


CT
CAP C0MM, Goldstone. Roger.


CT
Houston CAP COMM, Goldstone M&amp;0 NET 1.


CC
Go.


CT
The TV people do not have access to NET 1 in that area. Suggest we use NET 2 For that purpose.


CC
Okay. Going to NET 2.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV guys say they have some horizontal banding across the upper part of the picture and across the lower part. They would consider the lines just straight, no waviness to them at all. Over.


LMP
Roger. Understand. They do seem to distort vertical lines though.


 CC
Say again about the vertical lines, Buzz.


LMP
Roger. When there's a vertical line, these horizontal bands tend to put small waves in it.


CC
Roger. I copy. He didn't mention that. Stand by, I'll check again.


CC
Hello, 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV said that when you get a sharp vertical line on the picture, when the horizontal banding goes across, it does appear to bend it slightly. The same as Apollo 10, they said. Looks okay to them. Over.


LMP
Okay. Understand. It's not our monitor. It must be the transmitter or the system.


CC
Roger. I guess so, Buzz. We'll have them look into it, and see if they can suggest anything.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've lost our command interface with Goldstone. We'd like you to switch to 0MNI Delta. Over.







LMP
Roger. Going to Delta.


CC
Roger.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to terminate the O2 purge if you have not done so already, and the TV camera people say that the lines are inherent in the camera, Buzz; and it's something that we expected. Over.


LMP
Roger. Understand about the camera. Say again about the O2 purge.

Roger. We can terminate the O2 purge at this time. Over.


LMP
Oh, okay. Fine. Will do.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're just about to the limits where we can get any kind of picture at all on the OMNI's on the TV. It - The picture, I guess, would be just almost zero at this point.


CMP
Okay. Well, for this TV program coming up in a couple of hours, you might give some thought to how you want us to stop PTC, if you do, for the best high gain angle; and also it would be nice if you could stop us at such an attitude that we'd have the Earth out of one of our windows.


CC
Roger, 11. We're thinking about that.







CMP
Okay.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got some PIPA biases and general drift updates for you if you give us P00 and ACCEPT. Over.


CDR
Okay, Charlie. Stant by one.


CC
Roger, 11. The - -


CDR
You've got it.


CC
Okay. Thank you much. Our biggest drift on the GYRO's is 0.03 degrees per hour with - on the X-GYRO. On the PIPA's, the Y-PIPA's the biggest and it's 0.006 feet per second so ... trying to tweak it up. The biggest we have is about one sigma on both GYRO's and accelerometers.


CDR
Sounds good.

Roger. We just had a really big thunderstorm here about a hour ago. Couple of storms around the area ... Over.


LMP
Yes. I see one fairly large and isolated one. There are couple of more off to the left, but this one looks fairly good size. It could very well be the one that just passed over you.


CC
Roger.


LMP
Yes, and it looks like the Cape has been having a little bit of rain, too.


CC
Roger. The one we had here came in from the west and is moving east - or nearly so, as far as I could tell.


LMP
That view through this sextant is fantastic. I can see Alaska right up - right up along the LM, and I'm running the crosshairs right now down the coast of California, the west coast of Mexico, Yucatan Peninsula, up around the Gulf, Florida, Cuba, down Central America, and I'm running into the stop right now, on the sextant.

CC
11, Houston. Do you see any predominant weather systems as far as frontal type or any buildup of tropical-storm type? Over.


LMP
Not any large ones. There are a couple of smaller disturbances. Well, there's one maybe 300 miles north of Cuba, but it doesn't look cyclonic.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got a TV attitude for you and also an update to your CMC erasable load and your alternate contingency checklist, if you could break that out too. Over.


LMP
Roger. I'm not sure I caught all of that. Go ahead with what you have.


CC
Roger, 11. If you'll break out your alternate and contingency checklist for the CSM, we got an update to some of the erasable loads on page F2-20, Over.


LMP
Okay. Be getting that out, and you can give us the attitude for TV.


CC
Roger, 11. Your TV attitude will be roll 261, pitch 090, yaw 000. High gain angle: pitch plus 28, yaw 271. That puts the left-hand window pointed at the Earth. We recommend exiting PTC with your updated procedure in the checklist. Over.


LMP
Roger. We copy roll 21 - 61, pitch 090, yaw 000, high gain pitch plus 28, yaw 271. And we'll like this with the DELTA-V that we have in the book. Over.


CC
That's affirmative.


CMP
Charlie, Apollo 11. I have a couple of questions on stopping the PTC. It seems to me the easiest way to stop it would be - we're essentially, of course, at 0 degrees yaw and closing up to 90 degrees pitch, so it's just a question of stopping at 260 roll, roughly, and - How about for a procedure going MANUAL ATTITUDE, three to RATE COMMAND and then, seeing as how our deadband has already collapsed, I'll turn on the panel 8 RCS thrusters, at which time it should stop at whatever attitude it finds itself in. And if I do all of that as it comes up on 261 degrees roll, we should stop right there. Is that sufficient?






CC
Sounds pretty good. Stand by one.


CMP
Sounds like it might save a little gas.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. What page do you want in that revision? Over.


CC
Roger, 11. If you'll turn to page F2-20. Over.

Go ahead.


CC
Roger, Mike. We'd like to see you go to ACCEL COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches. Then to turn on the AUTO RCS SELECT switches, and then go RATE COMMAND. That will prevent us from firing jets uncoupled. Over.


CMP
Okay. Fine. And I would guess go RATE COMMAND and roll first and then followed by pitch and yaw.


CC
Okay. That sounds good if - And when you get to the roll attitude desired, just go RATE COMMAND at that time and it'll stop us right on.


CMP
Yes. I agree, Charlie. That sounds right.


CC
Roger.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston with some more words on exiting PTC. Over.







CMP
Go ahead, Charlie.


CC
Roger. Mike, when you were playing with the P37 a while ago and we collapsed the deadband back down, the DAP assumed that the deadband was centered around the new attitude that we happened to be at, at that time. Since then, we've drifted out a couple of degrees in both pitch and yaw from that attitude such that if we did the procedure as we called it up to you of going ACCEL COMMAND, turning on all of the AUTO RCS SELECT switches and then RATE COMMAND, it would attempt to fly back to the pitch and yaw attitude that it had when the deadband collapsed. We can prevent that by - just immediately prior to going to RATE COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches, if you cycle the SPACECRAFT CONTROL switch to SCS, then back to CMC. Over.


CMP
Sounds like a winner.


CC
Okay.


CMP
I'm not going to let these LM guys play with my DSKY anymore.


CC
You sound like you'd better protect it. It looks like just about anything that you do with that DSKY is going to collapse that deadband back down.


CMP
Understand.


CMP
Charlie, we just STABED to 261 degrees roll, and it looks like whoever figured it out did a good Job. It's right there, dab-smack in the middle of window number 1.


CC
Sounds great.


LMP
Looks like Houston's still got a little smog over it, Charlie.


CC
We've got a constant overcast here in the room. We'll be right there. Stand by.


LMP
Of course, a little cloud from up here probably covers 8 or 10 states.


CC
11, Houston. Some of our guys just came in from outside and said it's pretty clear over the center here. It's cleared up completely. All the storms have moved on.







LMP
Very good.


LMP
Oh, yes, Charlie. I can see it through the sextant now, and I can see the coastline is clear. Those clouds are just inland a few miles.


CC
Okay. We copy.


LMP
Looks like the southeast part of the country is all socked in.


LMP
California looks nice. The San Joaquin Valley shows up as a real dark spot with a lighter brown on either side of it. You can't tell that it's green. It looks just sort of dark gray or maybe even real dark blue.


CC
How does the Mojave look? Is it clear?


LMP
Yes. As usual.


CC
Roger. The - around -


LMP
It looks like there's some clouds just to the west of the Sierras, northeast of Bakersfield a little bit; and crossing over into the Mojave from Bakersfield looks clear; and then as you get on further to the southeast of there, there's a few clouds.


CC
Roger, 11. Can you pick out Edwards in the sextant? Over.


LMP
I can see a 104 taxiing out for takeoff on the runway.


CC
Hey, man. That's super.


LMP
These dang bastards almost always have a 104 taxiing out for takeoff.


CC
11, Houston. Could you pick out anything around Edwards, a dry lake or anything? Over.


LMP
Negative, Charlie. I just - I don't have that resolution. But to give you some idea, I can - on the lower Texas coast, I can see - knowing what I'm looking for, I can see Padre Island. I can just barely make out the fact that there's a thin spit of land and then there's a little dark zone which is the Laguna Madre between it and the mainland.







CC
Roger, 11. That's pretty significant. Thank you much, Buzz.


LMP
Right.


LMP
How far out are we, Charlie?


CC
Stand by. I'll give it to you exactly. Looks like around 130,000, but stand by.


LMP
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. The exact range is 125,200 miles, and you're traveling 4486 feet per second.


LMP
Pretty far and pretty slow. Just past halfway.


LMP
Hey, Charlie, what the latest on Luna 15?


CC
Say again, Buzz? Over.


LMP
Roger. What's the latest on Luna 15?


CC
Stand by. I'll get the straight story for you.


END OF TAPE



APOLLO 11 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION




CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.


CMP
Go ahead, Charlie.


CC
Roger. Latest on Luna 15 - TASS reported this morning that the spacecraft was placed in orbit close to the lunar surface, and everything seems to be functioning normally on the vehicle. Sir Bernard Lovell said the craft appears to be in an orbit of about 62 nautical miles. Over.


CMP
Okay. Thank you, Charlie.


CC
And also, President Nixon has reported - or declared a day of participation on Monday for all federal employees to enable everybody to follow your activities on the surface. Many state and city governments and businesses throughout the country are also giving their employees the day off, so it looks like you're going to have a pretty large audience for the EVA.


CMP
Oh, that's very nice, Charlie. I'll tell Neil about it.


CDR
Houston, Apollo 11. We've stopped PTC. We're in the right position; we're setting up for TV.


CC
Roger.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We have you stopped in the PTC; attitude looks good to us. Mike, I would like to get a COMM check. The last couple of the transmissions from the spacecraft has been garbled from especially Buzz. Could you both give me a COMM check? Over.


LMP
Roger, Charlie. Buzz here. How do you read? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.


CC
Roger. You are about four-by with a slight decrease/increase in volume, sort of a wavy volume to it. Over.


LMP
Okay. I moved my mike around. How about now? Is this any better?


CC
Hey, that's beautiful right there. Thank you.


CMP
Okay, Charlie. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. How do you read me?







CC
Roger. You're five-by. Is Neil on?


CDR
1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.


CC
Roger, Neil. You're five-by.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got the network all configured for the TV. You can start any time you want. Over.


CC
Okay, 11. We have a picture. We see the Earth right in the center of the screen. Over.


CDR
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11 calling in from about 130,000 miles out. And we'll zoom our camera in slowly and get the most magnification we can. Over.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. The definition is pretty good on our monitor here. The color is not too ..., at least on this set. Could you describe what you're looking at? Over.


CDR
Roger. You're seeing Earth, as we see it, out our left-hand window, just a little more than a half Earth. We're looking at the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the north half of the top half of the screen, we can see North America, Alaska, United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. South America becomes invisible just off beyond the terminator or inside the shadow. We can see the oceans with a definite blue cast, see white bands of major cloud formations across the Earth, and can see coastlines, pick out the western U.S., San Joaquin Valley, the Sierra mountain range, the peninsula of Baja California, and we can see some cloud formations over southeastern U.S. There's one definite mild storm southwest of Alaska, looks like about 500 to 1000 miles, and another very minor storm showing the south end of the screen near the - or a long ways off of the equator, probably 45 degrees or more south latitude. Can pick out the browns in the landforms pretty well. Greens do not show up very well. Some greens showing along the northeastern - northwestern coast of the United States and northwestern coast of Canada.


01 l0 03 44        CC
Roger, 11. It's a pretty good picture on clarity here. We're having - can you tell us - It appears to us that there are two distinct cloud- formations







trending east/west, one approximately about along the equator, and one around 30 or so south latitude. Could you tell us exactly where those cross the landmasses? Over.


CDR
Yes. They cross just south of the lower part of Mexico, probably through Central America. That is the equatorial band which we assume to be the intertropical convergence zone. The other band, which stands about 30 south, correctly appears to join the equator at the far left, or just beyond the horizon on the left edge of Earth, or at least it looks like it's going to join it. We don't have an explanation for that banding.


CC
Roger, Neil. Thank you. It also appears that just to the left of the terminator, up in the northern hemisphere, there's a cloudband trending - a gap in the cloud, trending northwest/southeast. It appears to us that that comes in about over the northern United States, or perhaps the central United States. Is that about correct? Over.


CDR
I can see on the monitor the thing you were talking about, but right now I can't get my eye to the window to pick out just where it crosses the shoreline.


CC
Roger.


CC
You guys are doing a good job. It's a real steady picture, here. We're - Clarity is excellent. The color, it's - the clouds are - The whites are distinct. The rest if it looks like, to me anyway on the monitor I'm observing, is a fairly greenish blue is the way I'd describe it. Over.


CC
It appears that the - -


CDR
Well, we can't observe much green from the spacecraft.


CC
Roger. On this monitor, the landmasses appear to be just a darker grayish color rather than a brown.


CDR
Well, it's true that we do not have the depths of color at this range that we enjoyed at 50,000 miles out. However, the oceans still are a definite blue and the continents are generally brownish in cast,







although it is true that they're tending more toward gray now than they were at the closer range.


CC
Roger, 11. We've been - I've just been vectored to another monitor and sure enough, the browns are coming in a lot more distinctly on the Eidephor that we have up on our screen in the control center. Over.


CDR
Okay, world, hold on to your hat. I'm going to turn you upside-down.


CC
11, that's a pretty good roll, there.


CDR
Oh, I'd say sloppy, Charlie. Let me try that one again.


CC
You'll never beat out the thunderbird.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. That practice did you some good. It's looking - real smooth roll, there.


CC
Oops! Spoke too soon.


CDR
I'm making myself seasick doing it, Charlie. I'll just put you back rightside-up where you belong.


CC
Roger.


CDR
You don't get to do that every day.


CC
11, Houston. Could you describe, from your view, the polar cloudcap? It appears to us to extend down the western coast of North America. Would you estimate how far it extends down? Over.


LMP
Trying to fit everybody into the window.


CDR
It appears that the cloudcap comes down a little bit below the southern extremity of Alaska.


CC
Roger.


CC
We've - 11, we've lost our picture here, now.


CC
Okay. Apollo 11, Houston. We've got the picture back now.







CDR
Unfortunately, we only have one window that has a view of the Earth and it's filled up with the TV camera, so your view now is probably better than ours is.


CC
Roger. We copy.


CC
11, Houston. If you could comply, we'd like to see a little smiling faces up there, if you could give us some interior views. I'm sure everybody would like to see you. Over.


CDR
Okay. We'll reconfigure the TV for that.


CC
Roger.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. It appears to us that we're seeing a view from outside plus a little of the inside. It appears you've taken the camera away from the left window now. Over.


CDR
That's correct. We're moving it back and reconfiguring for interior lighting.


CC
Roger.


CC
We can still see the Earth through the left window, and it appears that we can see a floodlight off to the left, either that or some Sun shafting through the hatch window.


CDR
It's a floodlight.


CC
Roger.


CC
Now we're coming in. Can't quite make out who that ...


CC
That's big Mike Collins, there - -


CMP
You got a little bit of - Yes, hello there sports fans. You got a little bit of me, plus Neil is in the center couch, and Buzz is doing the camera work at this time.


CC
Roger. It's a little dark now, 11. Maybe a bigger f-stop might help.


CMP
Yes, that's in work.


CC
It's getting a lot better now, 11. Mike, you're coming in five-by. I got a good -







CMP
I would have put on a coat and tie if I'd known about this ahead of time.


CC
Is Buzz holding your cue cards for you. Over.


CMP
Cue cards have a no. We have no intertions of competing with the professionals, believe me. We are very comfortable up here, though. We do have a happy home. There's plenty of room for the three of us and I think we're all learning to find our favorite little corner to sit in. Zero g is very comfortable, but after a while you get to the point where you sort of get tired of rattling around and banging off the ceiling and the floor and the side, so you tend to find a little corner somewhere and put your knees up or something like that to wedge yourself in, and that seems more at home.


CC
Roger. Looks like Neil is coming in five-by there, 11. Mike, see you in the background. The definition is really outstanding. The colors are good. It's a real good picture we're getting here of Commander Armstrong. We - Buzz, when you take the camera over towards the window where the Sun's shafting through, it tends to blank it out, though.


CMP
Yes, Neil's standing on his head again. He's trying to make me nervous.


CC
Roger.


CMP
He's disappearing up into the tunnel, of course, as he would going into the lunar module, only backwards.


CC
Roger. We 'can see portions of the LEB now. The systems test meter panel, in the lower part of the picture, or we did have it, anyway.


CMP
0kay. And directly behind his head are our optical instruments, the sextant and the telescope that we use to take sightings with.


CC
Roger. Copy. And we see the DSKY flashing with a 651. In fact, we can read registers 1 and 2 quite clearly.


CMP
We have the old high gain angles telling us which way the Earth is.







CC
Copy. That's a beautiful picture. Clarity is outstanding.


CMP
We can also give you the time of day in our system of mission elapsed time. Elapsed time: 34 hours 16 minutes and umpteen seconds. Can you see that clearly enough, Charlie?


CC
Roger, Apollo 11. We can see it counting up every - every second. We got 34 17 02 now.


CMP
Okay. Back to the high-gain angles.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Now we have amputated those.


CC
11, Houston. We have a beautiful rainbow there now as you move the camera around. ... That looks like the star charts coming into view, now. Over.


CMP
Yes. Those are Buzz's two star charts that he is using right now as sun shades over the righthand window, window number 5.


CC
Roger. We see the sun shining in through it behind him and plotting out the equatorial - correction, ecliptic plane, and the stars that you're using for the navigation.


CMP
Roger. He doesn't really need the charts. He's got them memorized. They're just for show.


CC
We copy.


LMP
While we're pointing up in this direction, we see out our side windows the Sun going by and, of course, out one of our windows right now we've got the Earth. Now right behind my window, of course, we have the Sun, because the Sun is illuminating the star charts that we see. This line represents the ecliptic plane and these lines, vertical lines, represent our reference system that the spacecraft is using at this time. As we approach the Moon, the Moon will gradually grow larger and larger in size and eventually it will







be in - it will be eclipsing the Sun as we go behind it, as we approach the lunar orbit insertion maneuver.


CC
Roger, 11. We've - Could you attempt a little bit better focus there, 11? Over.


CC
11, Houston. That's a lot better on the star chart now. We can make out the ecliptic plane and the planets and the Sun and the Moon as they have gone at various places throughout the ecliptic plane. Over.


CMP
Okay, Charlie.


LMP
If we can get some of the wires untangled here, we'll give you a demonstration of how easy pushups are up here.


CC
11, Roger. Good view of Buzz, there.


LMP
When it gets pretty hard doing it that way, we just roll over and do it the other way.


CC
Roger. We copy. We couldn't figure out whether that was a chinup or a pushup. just take your choice, I guess.


CMP
Well, it looks like it's probably almost your dinner time down there, Earth. We'll show you our food cabinet here in a second.


CC
11, Roger.


CC
11, Houston. We see a box full of goodies there. Over.


CMP
We really have them, Charlie. We've got all kinds of good stuff. We've got coffee up here in the upper left and various breakfast items, bacon in little small bites, beverages like fruit drink, and over in the center part we have, oh, all kinds of things. Let me pull one out here and see what it is.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Would you believe you're looking at chicken stew, here? All you have to do is - 3 ounces of hot water for 5 or 10 minutes. Now we get our hot water out of a little spigot up here with a







filter on it that filters any gases that may be in the drinking water out, and we just stick the end of this little tube in the end of the spigot and pull the trigger three times for 3 ounces of hot water and then mush it up and slice the end off it and there you go, beautiful chicken stew.


CC
Sounds delicious.


CMP
Yes. The food so far has been very good. We couldn't be happier with it.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Could I borrow that flashlight a second?


CC
The surgeons are saying thank you, there, for that.


CMP
And it is sort of down in a dark corner, so we have a flashlight here to help us see things; and if I can let go of it carefully, it'll just hold itself right where it is.


CC
Roger.


01 10 24 25 CMP
As long as it's ..., it will.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. That's a pretty good demonstration. You started off really stable there, Mike. It's -


CMP
Well, the problem is, no matter how carefully you let go, you bump it just a tiny little bit and set it in motion, and once in motion there she goes. Try that again.


CC
It looks fairly stable now with slow rotation.


CMP
Well, so much for the food department. I'm going to close up the store down here.


CC
Roger. We copy.


LMP
Charlie, we checked out the cable lengths, and we're thinking we might want to see if we can take the TV into the LM with us tomorrow for part of the time. Over.







CC
Roger. Good show. We'd like to see it if it'll reach that far. Over.


LMP
We'll give it a try.


CC
Roger.


CMP
And where we sleep is down underneath this couch.


CC
Houston. Roger.


CC
Slowly sinking into the sack there.


CMP
It's really comfortable.


CMP
Forgot to give Buzz his flashlight back.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give the folks a view of your patch on your CWG's? Over.


CMP
Stand by one, Charlie; we'll try and give you a closeup.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. We have the patch. Could you attempt to improve the focus slightly? Over.


CC
11, Houston. The scan on the camera makes the - that's a little bit better now. The flashlight seems to flicker, due to the scan on the TV. We can't see the eagle. Now it's a little bit better. Over. Could you open the f-stop a little bit more? Over.


CMP
It's open all the way. We're going to have to move Buzz around a little bit.


CC
Roger.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. The color is better now. It's coming in. We could attempt a little bit better focus on it. There we go; it focuses a lot better now. We see the eagle coming right in on the lunar surface. Over. That's very good now.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. That's very good now. We can see the Earth in the background, Apollo 11, and the eagle coming in.







CMP
It's probably pretty hard to see the olive branch, isn't it?


CC
Roger. It is.


CMP
Well, that's what he has in his talons, is an olive branch.


01 l0 30 16        CC

01 l0 30 39        CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We're really impressed with the clarity and the detail that we have in the picture. The colors are - now, it's really an excellent picture now that I'm looking at it on our monitor, which is about 12 seconds before the networks can get it out due to the conversion that we have here on our TV converter. We're looking at the controls in the main display console. We can see the DSKY up on the panel. Over.


CMP
That would be nice if you could take a look at all the circuit breakers; make sure the right ones are in and the right ones are out.


CC
Roger. Big Bubba's watching.

Okay.

LMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Roger, 11. The problem on that initially - starting up the PTC was we failed to do the VERB 49 which - and load the desired initial attitude; so the DAP tried to take it back to the old attitude that we had started up in number of hours to go. That's why we picked up the rates in the other axes. We're going to wait in this attitude for about 20 minutes to dump out the rates again, and than we'll proceed with the VERB 49 and load our attitude that we have at the time - at this time. Over.

At this roll attitude, what should our highgain angles be? Maybe that would help us locate you. We don't see you in the lens.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Those high gain angles are pitch minus 70, yaw 90. We think the Earth is apparently pretty close to plus z-axis. Over.

Okay, Charlie. I got you in the telescope.







CC
Roger, Apollo 11. We've got a laser that we're going to - It's a blue-green laser that we're going to flash on and off at a frequency of on for a second, off for a second. It's coming out of McDonald Observatory near El Paso, which is - should be right on the terminator - or right inside the terminator. We are going to activate that momentarily. Would you please take a look through the telescope and see if you can see it. Over.


CMP
Telescope? Or sextant?

Either one. Over.

CC
Roger. We've finally gotten concurrence on our problem here with 50 guys looking at it. When we were sitting in the 5018, we attempted to load the erasable before you terminated the VERB 49. So Mike, what we're going to have to do is call up the present CDU's, copy those down, and do a VERB 49, load the present, then do a PROCEED, then an ENTER, and then we can then set up ATTITUDE HOLD in step 6. Over.


CMP
Okay. I think that's what we did last time.


CC
It appeared to us that we attempted to load the erasable prior to entering on the VERB 49 which VERB 49 was still running, and it clobbered the CDU's. Over.

CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Roger. Mike, I think we can explain that seventenths rate. When we - the first time through, you know, we failed to go through the VERB 49, so we had a large error between our actual CDU and desired CDU in roll. And with that situation,







the DAP - the vehicle will roll - will maneuver, rather, at a rate that is loaded in, which was three-tenths plus four-tenths rate, and it will limit at four-tenths above the desired rate, so - that is if we have a large enough angle between the desired and the actual, which we did. So, therefore, the rate was four tenths plus three tenths to give you the seven tenths. Over.


CMP
Okay. Thank you.

Roger.

When you feel up to copying, 11, I've got a couple of small items in the way of a flight plan update and your morning consumables update. Over.


LMP
Apollo 11.







CC
Roger, 11. We'd like to perform a waste-water dump at your convenience some time in the near future here. No particular time scheduled. Down air at the time for midcourse correction 3, which is about 53 55, we're deleting midcourse correction number 3 and all the items associated with it. For your information, the calculated value of the burn for midcourse number 3 was eight tenths of a foot per second, that is 0.8 feet per second. Canceling this, if we decide to burn midcourse correction 4, this would then give you a burn for midcourse correction 4 of 2.0 feet per second. At 53 hours we have an IMU realign P52. We're requesting that you do this while in PTC, and we plan to continue PTC throughout the day. Over.


CMP
- then we'll get to the waste-water dump - -


CC
Say again, please. You're cutting out.


LMP

CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over


LMP
Apollo 11, go ahead.


CC
Roger, 11. Did you copy the flight plan update items? Over.


LMP
Roger. How do you read me now, Bruce?


LMP
Okay. The battery charge is in the process now and the wastewater dump is in work. MCC 3 has been canceled. It would have been 0.8 feet per second. MCC 4 now looks like about 2.4 feet per second. At around 53 hours we'll do a P52 in PTC. Over.







CC
Roger, 11. The magnitudes of the midcourse corrections were just for your information, but midcourse 4 was down around 2.0 feet per second. Again, for your information, on SPS chamber pressure, it looks like your onboard readout of 87 psi corresponds to 92 psi by our telemetry, and your value of 89 on board corresponds to 94. Over.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Radio check on a new power amplifier in our transmitter. Over.


LMP
Roger. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.


CC
Roger. Loud and clear. Did you copy my notes on SPS chamber pressure?


LMP
Negative.


CC
Okay. Just for your information again, it appears that your readout of 87 psi corresponds to our corrected TM readout of 92 - that's 92 psi, and 89 on board is really 94 psi. Over.


LMP
Roger, I got that you were reading about 5 psi low.


CC
Roger. And are you ready for the consumables update?


LMP
Ready to copy.


CC
Okay. Consumables update for GET of 46 plus 00: minus 5.5 percent, minus 6.5 percent, minus 2.5 percent, minus 7.5 percent, minus 5.0 percent, minus 2 pounds hydrogen, plus 1 pound oxygen, and that minus 5.5 percent on the RCS total corresponds to minus 66 pounds. Over.

CMP
Houston, we're getting CRYO pressure warning now in the middle of stirring up the ...


CC
Roger. We copy.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We've got the continent of Africa ... facing toward us right now, and of course, everything's getting smaller and smaller as time goes on. The Mediterranean is completely clear. The Sun looks like it's about to set around Madagascar. The equatorial belt of Africa stands out quite clearly. We're seeing the dark green or a muddy colored green, compared to the sandier colors in the southern tip of Africa and, of course, the Sahara northern coast of Africa. There's a rather remarkable cloud that appears in the vicinity of the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's just about to go into the sunset now. It is casting quite a large shadow. It's isolated. There don't seem to be any other clouds ... the band of clouds near the tropical conversions clouds down around the equator clearly separate the clockwise and the counterclockwise cloud formations. Over.


CC
Roger, 11. We copy your word description on that. I understand you can see a shadow being cast by that cloud over between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any estimate on how long that shadow would be? Over.


LMP
It looks like it's a shadow. Coming around to - back that way - -


CC
We're getting a lot of background noise now, also. If you will stand by a minute or so until we roll a little further in PTC, I think things will get better.


LMP
Okay. It's coming around to the number 1 window. We'll get you ...


CC
Roger, we're hearing you.


CC
11, this is Houston. The noise on the COMM seems to have quieted down now. I guess that we've rotated a new antenna into view and probably also the Earth out of view in your window. Over.


LMP
Okay. It looks as though the length of the shadow of that cloud is about the same as the width of the Persian Gulf.







CC
Okay. We copy the width of the Persian Gulf, and I guess that all I can give you firsthand is a single isolated data point, and that is that it was clear here in Houston this morning. That's a pretty localized observation. As a result of your waste water dump, it looks like the PTC mode has been disturbed somewhat. We're showing you about 20 degrees out in pitch right now and about 6 degrees in yaw, which is significantly greater, about twice as much - a little more than twice as much as the deviation you had prior to the waste water dump. We' re watching it down here, though, and we'll let you know if we think any corrective action is required. Over.


LMP
Okay. Maybe we ought to - next time split that in half, and put half of it on one side and half on the other or something like that.


CC
Yes. We could do that. We were actually pretty interested in seeing what the effect on PTC would be of the waste water dump. We don't recall ever having performed a waste water dump during PTC on previous missions. Over.


LMP
Well, now we know.


CC
Roger.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. I am looking at that cloud now around Pakistan through the sextant, and it appears to be one single cell in the latter stages of development. There is a smaller, more isolated one - -

CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We lost you down in the noise on the COMM link here about the time you were describing the single cell cloud formation over Afghanistan-Pakistan area through the sextant. Over.


LMP
Roger. It came through a lot clearer through the sextant than with the monocular, and you could definitely tell it was one single cell in the latter stages of development. It must have gone up to over 50,000 feet, though. The eastern Mediterranean is phenomenally clear. You can see all the lakes; the Dead Sea stood out quite well. Over.


CC
Roger. What appears to be the limit of resolution through that sextant from your current position? Over.


LMP
Well, I can't see it right now. It's outside the field of view.


CC
Roger.


LMP
And, I don't know yow you'd really describe the limit of resolution. I will think about that a little.


CC
Okay. I guess the smallest object that you could pick out looking through it would give us a pretty good hack.


LMP
Well, you can see the Nile River going almost up to its source. The lake is obscured by clouds, but you can trace it all the way on up.


CC
Roger.

CMP
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. We have been working under the assumption that it would take about an hour for the interference from a waste water dump to dissipate to the point where you could reasonably take star sightings for platform alignment navigation or something of this sort. If you have a spare minute or two, could you comment on the observation condition, now? Over.







CMP
Yes. Stand by one, Bruce.


CC
Okay.


CMP
My guess would be the telescope's probably pretty useless, but you can differentiate in the sextant between water droplets and stars by the difference in their motions.


CC
Okay, Mike. I guess that we've still got - what you are saying is that we've still got a lot of water droplets visible, but you can pick them out and distinguish them in the sextant, then.


CMP
Right. I think so. Buzz is looking through it now. Just a second.


CC
Okay.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. It looks like at this time the sextant would be quite usable for any alignment. There's actually very few ... verticals.


CC
Roger, Buzz. How about the telescope? Is it useful now?


LMP
Well, it's not quite as useful; it never seems to be. Depending on the position of the Sun, it's got that band that seems to go across the center. I don't think it's because of the waste water particles that it would lack its effectiveness. Over.


CC
Roger. What - Is this band something that's deposited on the outside of the optics? Over.


LMP
No. I see the reflection from the Sun.


CC
Roger.


CMP
The Sun bounces off the LM structure. With the LM attached, that telescope is just about useless. Those star charts that MPAD provided us, I think, would be most useful if we had to use the - if for some reason we had to mark through the telescope. We could use those as a guide for what we're looking at and say, "Well, that bright blob over there has got to be that star because that's the position we're in." But so far, we've not been able to pick out any decent star patterns while docked with the LM using the telescope.

Roger. You're coming back a little scratchy. It,looks like our O2 flow transducer's gotten a good bit worse. I just looked at it at the last water accumulator cycling, and it just barely registered - barely crept up above 0.2. Over.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, this is Houston. At the time of your cyclic accumulator stroking, we were on low-bit-rate data, and consequently not receiving the O2 flow parameter. We expect that what you're seeing is probably nominal. That is, it's probably what we would expect from a transducer that's malfunctioning probably in this fashion, and it's just going to keep on getting worse like that. Nothing to worry about. We'll monitor things on the ground here. Over.

CC
Roger. In Washington, the Senate Finance Committee has approved extension of the income tax surtax, but a Senate vote on the bill currently seemed remote. In Austin, State Representative Ray Lemmon of Houston has been nominated as the National Director of the American Society for Oceanography. Lemmon has proposed a study of the possibility of establishing an institute of oceanography in Texas. This would be the first such institute on the western Gulf of Mexico.







In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the weather bureau, after recapping today's weather showing a high of 88 and a low of 72, has noted "snowfall: none." From St. Petersburg, Florida, comes a radio report from the Norwegian explorer, Thor Heyerdahl, which said that the crew of his papyrus boat, the Ra, will sail into Bridgetown, Barbados, despite damage from heavy seas. The crew, however, will sleep on an escort vessel. Norman Baker, navigator of the expedition, said the crew was aboard the Ra today repairing damage from storms this past week, which split the footing of the mast. Part of the broken mast was jettisoned overboard, and the vessel was 725 miles east of the Barbados. "It is possible but uncomfortable to sleep aboard the Ra," Baker said in the radio report. "But the purpose of our voyage is not a test of strength or human endurance." That is the reason why the crew was spending nights aboard the escort vessel Shenandoah, which rendezvoused with the Ra on Tuesday.


CC
In sports, the Houston Oilers are showing plenty of enthusiasm in their early preseason workouts at Kerrville, and Coach Wally Lemm says he is impressed with the fine group of rookies. National League baseball yesterday, Thursday: St. Louis 11, Philadelphia 3; Montreal 5, over Pittsburg 4; Atlanta 12, Cincinnati 2; San Fransciso 14, and Los Angeles 13. American League: we have Baltimore 3, over Cleveland 2; Detroit 4 to Washington's 3; Minnesota 8 to Chicago 5. Boston at New York was rained out. And in Corby, England, an Irishman, John Coyle has won the world's porridge eating championship by consuming 23 bowls of instant oatmeal in a 10-minute time limit from a field of 35 other competitors.

CMP
He's on his - He's on his 19th bowl.


CC
Roger. Are you having any difficulties with gas in the food bags like the 10 crew reported?


CMP
Well, that's intermittently affirmative, Bruce. We have these two hydrogen filters, which work fine as long as you don't hook them up to a food bag. But the entry way into the food bag has enough back pressure to cause the - the filters to start losing their efficiency. A couple of times, I've been tempted to go through that dryout procedure, but we found that simply by leaving the filters alone for a couple of hours, their efficiency seems to be restored.


CC
Roger. We copy.


CMP
Their efficiency ranges anywhere from darn near perfect to terrible just depending on the individual characteristics of the food bags we're putting through them. Some of the food bags are so crimped near the entry-way that there's no way we can work them loose to prevent back pressure.

As you've probably noticed, your coning angle in PTC mode is increased substantially as a result of the waste water dump, the fuel cell purge, and a natural coupling, so it looks like we are going to have to terminate PTC here in a little while. And we'd like to get your feeling as to whether you're still anticipating trying to send back TV signals from inside the LM; and if so, we'll try to provide an attitude that you can hold that'll give us high gain antenna lock on the Earth during the TV and LM activation period. Over.


CDR
Yes, we're still planning that activity if the cord lengths work out all right, and we'll accept those attitudes that you work up for us.


CC
This is Houston. Roger. Out.







LMP
When you work up an attitude to get high gain, is there any way that we could get partial Sun in one of the two LM front windows?


CC
This is Houston. We'll have a look at it.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


CDR
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. We have a TV attitude for you if you're ready to copy.


CMP
Go ahead. Ready to copy.


CC
Okay. We recommend stopping PTC at GET of 54 45 00, and this should put you at just about the right roll angle. The attitude we recommend is roll 263, pitch 090, yaw 000. This gives you the Earth out of window number 1 in the command module and places the high gain antenna in the CSM window for TV at your convenience. You will also have the Sun shining in - or shining at the hatch on the LM, and if you take down the window shades you should get some sunlight in. We're recommending wide deadband. Over.


CMP
Roger. Thank you, Houston. We'll look at that.


CC
Roger. Out.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. When we pass the proper roll angle, we're not going to be anywhere near zero degrees yaw. Do you want us to just stop and try until we find ourselves in and then VERB 49 the three angles you gave us?


CC
Stand by.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to stop at the proper roll angle, then do a VERB 49 to the roll and pitch. Over. Correction, roll and yaw.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.


CC
Go ahead, 11. Over.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Do you read? Over.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.


02 06 44 22 CC
Roger, 11. Do you read me? Over.







CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.


CMP
Stand by, Charlie. Yes, we'r going to come out of PTC here at 263 roll and then do VERB 49 to thc recommended attitude.


CC
That sounds fine to us. Ovcr.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Before you open the pressure equalization valve, we'd like the LM/CM DELTA-P. Over.


CMP
Okay. Let me check it again. It was about 155.


CC
Roger.


CMP
I read it 158 right now, Charlie.


CC
Roger. Thank you much.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We're stopping PTC at 263 ... 0.


CC
11, Houston. You're about one-by on this transmission. Say again. Over.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Do you read?


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on the high gain?


CC
11, how do you read me? Over.


CMP
Read you loud and clear, Charlie. We just switched to HIGH GAIN, and we stopped PTC at roll 263, pitch 90, yaw 0. How do you read?


CC
Roger, Mike. You're five-by now on the high gain. We're right between the 0MNI antennas and pretty horrible COMM on the OMNI's. We got you five-by on the high gain, and we copy the PTC stoppage. Over.


CMP
Okay, fine.


CMP
Houston, we're going to open the DIRECT O2 valve and start pumping up the cabin.


CC
Roger. Copy.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We're going to hand over to Goldstone for uplink in about 2 minutes. We might have a momentary dropout of COMM. Over.







CMP
Alright. Can you hear our master alarm in the background? That's O2 FLOW HIGH coming through this amplifier.


CC
Roger. Copy.


CMP
That photoelectric cell is a good device. It's worked very well.


CC
11, Houston. Say again. Over.


CMP
I say that photoelectric cell amplifier for the master alarm is a good device. It's working very well, and it's a nice pleasing tone.


CC
Roger. Copy. Thank you.


CMP
Makes you almost glad to get master alarms.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. As a matter of curiosity, our O2 flow meter is pegged FULL-SCALE HIGH.


CC
Roger, 11. We copy that here. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Boy, that transducer's working somewhat.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. We'd like to try to attempt to correlate your O2 flow in transducer with the flow valve that you've got open. How far - How far open would you say you have the REPRESS O2? 0ver. Correction, the DIRECT O2.


CMP
Stand by, Charlie.


CMP
Okay, Charlie. It's not open very far. It's hard to give you a good reading without shunting it again, but the arrow is at about the one o'clock position. Now I reduce the flow, and I'll let it stabilize here. Right now our onboard reading is about 0.4, and that's with the arrow in the O2 valve at the two o'clock position. Would you rather have comparisons of O2 flow readings or would you rather have valve position comparisons?


CC
Roger. Stand by.


CC
EECOMM's say they'd like to look at valve positions. Over.







CMP
Okay. Well, we're holding steady now at 0.3 pound per hour, and our cabin pressure is about 54; and I'll close the valve momentarily and then open it again to this position and tell you how much travel is required.


CC
Roger.


CMP
It's about 30 degrees of travel, Charlie, from the closed position, which is with the arrow pointing at about three to three-thirty, four o'clock.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Our flow is stabilized now at 0.6.


CC
Roger. We copy. We're reading the same.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Yes, open it back to the one o'clock position.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Is that enough different positions, or you want more, Charlie?


CC
Mike, that's good - good enough. We're satisfied now. Over.


CMP
Okay.


END OF TAPE



APOLLO 11 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION




CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We've terminated direct O2, our cabin pressure is 57, and, as a matter of curiosity, when we turn the DIRECT O2 valve OFF, we get a master alarm just like they did in the spacecraft testing.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston, we have a little update for you. When you go into the LM, we'd like you to unstow and bring back to the command module the following items. Over.


CMP
Ready to copy.


CC
Roger. We'd like you to pick up the - out of the flight data file, the surface checklist, the mission rules NO-GO card, the DPS, APS, RCS limit cue card. Over.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. The reason we wanted you to bring those three items back, we'll have some updates for you, for those three. Over.


CMP
Roger. We figured you would.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We're getting the TV at Goldstone. We're not quite configured here at Houston for the transmission. We'll be up in a couple of minutes. Over.


CMP
Roger. This is just for free. This isn't what we had in mind.


CC
Roger.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. It's a pretty good show here. It looks like you almost got the probe out.


CMP
Yes, it's loose now.


CDR
Can you see that?


CC
Roger, Neil. It's really good.


CDR
Not much light up in that area, but apparently the TV set's able to pick it up.


CC
There are some bright spots shining on the probe. Apparently Sun shafting on it that just gets just about enough for us to make it out. Over.







CDR
I think those are the tunnel lights.


SC
...


CC
Oh, Okay. You're right.


CDR
Okay. It's loose now. Coming down.


CC
Roger.


CC
Looks like it's a little bit easier than doing that in the chamber.


CDR
You bet. This is the only way ...


CMP
You have to take it easy.


CDR
It's pretty massive, but it goes where you direct it.


CC
11, Houston. That's a beautiful picture now, we've got. We're looking at a 12-second delay. To us you are just bringing it down by the optics now.


CDR
Mike must have done a smooth job in that docking. There isn't a dent or a mark on the probe.


CC
Roger.


CC
We're really getting a great picture here, 11. Over.


CC
11, Houston. With a 12-foot cable, we estimate you should have about 5 to 6 feet excess when you get the camera into the LM. Over.


CDR
Roger.


CC
We can see the probe now. Correction, the drogue.


CDR
Roger.


CDR
Okay. Drogue removal's coming next.


CC
Roger. As we suspected.


CC
11, Houston. Now it's a good view of the storage area under the couch.


CC
11, Houston. Looks like you're pretty crowded in there with that drogue. Over.







CDR
Oh, it's not really bad.


CMP
This TV cable is getting in the way.


CC
We see lots of arms.


LMP
The only problem, Charlie, is these TV stagehands don't know where they stand.


CC
Well, you got to really have a union card, there. We can't really complain too much, I guess.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Do you have a little white dot in the bottom of your monitor - TV monitor? Over.


LMP
Roger. We do.


CC
Roger. I guess part of the camera's been burnt out down there. These are really beautiful pictures now, Buzz. Over. Real clear.


LMP
Okay. We might have got just a little bit of Sun in there. Is it just one small white dot?


CC
That's affirmative.


CMP
We went up in the tunnel checking the roll angle, Charlie, and it's 2.05 degrees.


CC
Roger. Copy. 2.05 on the roll CAL.


CMP
And that's a plus.


CC
Roger. Plus.


CC
11, Houston. The tunnel looks pretty clear to us. Somebody going up there now. Over.


CDR
It's Mike checking his connectors up there now.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. The lighting up in there looks very good to us at this time. Over.


CDR
I think that's mostly the camera. It - it's subdued to say the least.


CC
Roger. It's pretty - It's gathering pretty well to us. We see everything quite clearly up in there.


CMP
Well, the docking latches look good today just like they did yesterday. Everything up in there looks just fine.







CC
That sounds fine to us. Over.


CC
11, Houston. We can even read the decals up there on the LM hatch.


LMP
Well, let me zoom it up and see how much you can read.


CC
Okay.


CC
We can see the LM umbilical connection quite well there, Buzz. We see you zooming in on one of the decals now. It's, "To reset, unlatch handle; latch behind grip and pull back two full strokes." That's about all we can make out.


LMP
Hey, you get an A-plus.


CC
Thank you very much, sir. At least I passed my eye test.


LMP
I'm standing 6 feet from it, Charlie, and you can read it better than I can. There's something wrong with the system.


CC
Roger.


CC
That's a real good view of the LM hatch handle there, 11. 0ver.


CDR
Roger.


CDR
Looks like we'll be ready to go into the LM early if that's okay with you all down there.


CC
Roger. It's fine with us, Neil. Go ahead anytime you wish. Over.


CC
11, Houston. The white spot you see on your monitor, our TV people say it is a burn spot; but they expect it to dissipate after a couple of hours. Over.


LMP
Roger. Thank you.


CMP
Okay, the dump valve is actuated.


CC
Roger. Copy, 11. We see that very clearly. Is that you, Buzz, with your hand on it?


CMP
Yes.


LMP
Roger.







CC
11, Houston. We're really amazed at the quality of the picture up in the tunnel. It's really superb. Over.


LMP
It is, considering the amount of light up in there.


CMP
Roger. We're about to open our hatch now.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Roger. There's that same guy that, when you open up the door, why, he's waiting there for you, and he turns the lights on.


CC
How about that. Just like the refrigerator.


CC
Buzz, the view in through your - by your right - left shoulder there is so good we can see the ascent engine cover, the Velcro on it, and that's about all we can make out right now.


CC
Now we can see the helmet stowage bag - -


LMP
We don't see anything loose up there.


CC
Well, great. Looks good to us. We see the helmet storage bag.


CC
Hello, 11. Houston. We got a view of the PLSS there, off the right of our screen.


CC
11, Houston. Buzz, you already in? Over.


LMP
Roger. I'm halfway in, hanging out. Start turning around, I guess.


CC
Roger.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to read out the LCG reservoir sight level. Over.


CMP
Okay. Stand by.


CC
11, we have a good view of the window there. It looks like the Sun's finally coming through the shade.


LMP
Yes, I'm afraid it's - We're just about plus Z toward the Sun.


CC
That's affirmative. This attitude put both windows right toward the Sun - or the LM. Over.







LMP
Well, that may be good in some respects, but -


CC
We had a view, Buzz, of the utility light cord. ...


LMP
Now let me show you a view looking the other way.


CC
Roger. And we see right now the utility light or either the floodlight up there.


CC
I think now I see the utility light still in the stowage bag. Hey, that's a great shot right there. We see you in there. Guess that's Neil and Mike. Better be, anyway.


CC
We see you waving.


CC
11, Houston. That's really a beautiful shot.


CC
11, Houston. We didn't quite decipher that signal that just came from the CMP.


LMP
Just saying hello. On the LCG sight gage, you got about - oh, it looks like the white mark that's in the plunger is about a quarter to three-eighths inch out into the green away from the red. Is that what you'd like to see? Over.


CC
Stand by. Roger, Buzz. That looks good to us. Thank you much.


LMP
It is the white index, is it not, that you're interested in comparing whether it's in the red or green?


CC
Stand by. That's affirmative, Buzz. It looks good. That's a good reading for us. Over.


LMP
Okay.


CC
We had a shot moment - a moment ago of the suit disconnect valve.


LMP
I'll open up the windows and see what the lighting condition's going to be like.


CC
11, Houston. That's a real good view we have of the AOT. You're back now, Buzz, and notice you're taking down one of the window shades. Over.







CC
The light is superb.


LMP
How's the Sun coming in? How's the Sun coming in from this direction going to affect what you can see?


CC
It made it really super. The lighting is excellent in the - in the LM right now. We can make out the AOT, the ISA, and the left-hand window - there's a little glare off of that, but the LMP side the - with the shade down it's really excellent. Over.


LMP
Well, let's - I'm turned around, why I took the shade off my side first.


CC
Roger. We copy. The light level for the TV is really excellent. Over.


CDR
Yes, the lighting in the LM is very nice now, just like completely daylight; and everything is visible. A good bit lighter than the tunnel was earlier.


CC
Roger. We got a good view now, Neil, of the DEDA; and also Buzz's ACA.


LMP
Hey, I'm pointing it at the front hatch now. Everything seems to be in place down there.


CC
Roger, we got the dump valves in view. Over.


LMP
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. We see you removing the ISA now, folding it up, putting it up on the AOT. The instrument panels are coming into view behind.


LMP
Yes, I think it'd probably be best, since we've done SPS burn, to put it back over the instrument panel instead of putting it up over the PLSS on the recharge station. Would you care to comment on that one? We could do either just as easily.


CC
Stand by. We'll have an answer for you momentarily.


CC
11, Houston. That's really a super shot of the main display.







LMP
The vehicle is surprisingly free of any debris floating around. It's very clean.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. It's pretty hard to describe this view. It's really - really great.


LMP
Now you know how we feel.


LMP
Okay. Neil's OPS is about 57, 5800.


CC
Copy.


LMP
And mine's about 5800, also.


CC
Copy.


CC
11, Houston. That's a good shot of Neil's PLSS, there. Over.


LMP
No, that's mine.


CC
11, Houston. That moment - a moment ago, we had a good shot of your PLSS, Buzz, and the two helmet stowage bags. Down behind your left shoulder, Buzz, we have the - the DSKY and the ACA.


LMP
We're going to go ahead and take all the Moon data on back into the command module, Charlie.


CC
Roger.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz, it appears that you're intending to put on the Sun filter and view the Sun through the AOT. Over.


LMP
Yes, unfortunately it looks like it's down a little bit more towards ... than I can be able to see in the AOT.


CC
Roger.


LMP
We got a beautiful view of the side of the command module out of the AOT looking in the left rear detent.


CC
Roger.


LMP
I can see the hatch and all the - all the EVA handrails. First time we've seen the silvery outside of the command module.







LMP
I can read the letters on the hatch cover. It's a boost cover release; and the big yellow arrow that points toward the opening - place where the tool B goes.


CC
Roger. Great shot now back down into the -


CMP
And left on the - -


CC
Go ahead, Buzz. Over.


LMP
Say again.


CC
I was just saying we got a great shot looking back into the command module.


02 07 53 O9        LMP
...


LMP
Okay. And the left detent, I can see the AO - or the rendezvous radar, and I move to the forward detent and that's about all I've got. I'm looking eyeball to eyeball.


CC
Roger.


LMP
Charlie, is there any concern about the duration that we ought to have the window shades open?


CC
Stand by.


LMP
We don't have - We don't have any circulation in here, and it might get a little on the warm side.


CC
Roger.


CMP
We'll - We'll put up a couple of hoses in the command module here and get a little circulation going.


CC
Sounds like a good idea. Over.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. As far as the window shades go in this LM, there's nothing except for crew comfort. I don't think we've got any systems problem. Be sure to put them back up when you egress. Over.


LMP
That we will do.


LMP
Charlie, I'll give you a view out of the overhead window, back looking at the command module right-hand rendezvous window.







CC
Roger.


CC
Well, we see it now. Thanks a lot, Buzz. That's a good view through the overhead.


LMP
One washer on -


LMP
One washer's on by the overhead.


CC
Roger.


CC
There we go. We got it now.


LMP
There wasn't very much debris in the command module or the LM. We found very few loose particles of bolts, nuts, and screws and lint and things. Very few in each spacecraft. They were very clean.


CC
Roger. Sounds good.


CC
11, Houston. We have a good view out of the rendezvous - correction, the overhead window of the LM. We don't see anybody staring back at us, though. Over.


LMP
Charlie, can you see Mike's two eyeballs staring out through the rendezvous window?


CC
11, Houston. Stand by. We haven't picked him up yet.


LMP
You are looking through a lot of layers of glass.


CC
11, Houston. We had a - -


02 07 59 40 LMP
... on my monitor.


CC
We had a slight glimpse of Mike in the rendezvous window at that time. It's pretty murky looking into there, though.


LMP
Okay. Here he is; I've got him. I've got, him on the monitor now.


CC
Okay. We see him staring back at us now. Hello, in there.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Our recommendation for the ISA is to stow it back over the instrument panel. Over.


LMP
Roger. Will do.







CC
11, Houston. We can make out the markings on the panel. We read SYSTEM A ASCENT FUEL, ASCENT OXIDIZER. Quad 1, quad 4. The - It's really unbelievable, the definition we're getting down here off that little camera. Over.


CC
We can even see the barber pole on the talkbacks.


CC
We can read the markings on the instruments for the glycol pressure, quantity, PCO2. You can even read the scale on the eight ball. Over.


CC
11, Houston. We see the cross-feed barber pole, and we have the Velcro patches back up to the RCS systems now. We can see the markings on the meters, green and red bands, in limits.


CC
We see you raised the cover on the abort stage. We don't recommend that.


LMP
Yes. We're going to tape that one over.


CC
Roger.


LMP
We're going to tape that one over.


CC
We concur.


LMP
The restraints in here do a pretty good job of pulling my pants down.


CC
Roger. We haven't quite got that before the 50,000,000 TV audience, yet.


CC
11, Houston. That's a good view of the eight ball. We see - You can even read the OFF flag, there.


CC
You can see the signal strength meter for the radar, read the numbers on it.


LMP
Houston, did you want us to test the cameras in the LM and - I was wondering about that. I saw it in the flight plan, but I'm just wondering if you want to do that on CSM power, or do you want us to take both of the 16mm cameras back in the CSM and test them there? Over.


CC
Stand by, Buzz.


LMP
As an alternative to that, why, we could wait LOI day and do it then when we transfer over to LM power.







CC
Roger. Stand by. We'll have an answer.


CC
11, Houston. On that TV, our commentary - The monitor I was looking at was delayed about 12 seconds, 12 to 15 seconds while it went through our color converter. It was probably - You thought I was crazy, but we were looking at it 15 seconds after you broadcast it. 11, Houston - -


LMP
We understood that, Charlie.


CC
Okay. On the LM cameras, we'd like you to do it on LOI day with the LM power. Over.


LMP
Okay. That's what we'll do.


LMP
Houston, we're showing you something that came out of the Commander's checklist stowage packet. It's got a 16-millimeter camera in it, and it's got this little cylinder; and I guess - I don't understand what it is. Maybe you can tell us.


CC
Roger. Stand by. We can't figure it out either.


LMP
It's got an arrow on the back, and it says "turn," but I'm afraid to turn it.


CC
11, your friendly geologist says it's the camera cank- crank, excuse me, for the 16-sequence camera if it jams. Over.


LMP
All very well. Thank you.


LMP
There's that word again. The ancillary stowage container.


CC
Roger.


CC
The shades couldn't quite hack it, there, Buzz. Over.


CMP
Houston, 11. Are you still getting high bit rate off the OMNI's at this distance?


CC
Stand by, Mike.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. About 50 percent of the time, we're getting high bit rate off the OMNI's when you're in PTC. Over.


CMP
Okay. Thank you.


CC
You're welcome.







CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Neil, at this attitude you look like you're about 12 feet long.


CDR
It seems like I always find myself upside-down in whatever I'm doing around here.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give us a few comments on your crew comfort with the CSM hoses moving the air around? Over.


LMP
Well, it's picking up a little bit on circulation in here.


CC
What do you estimate the temperature is, Buzz? Over.


LMP
Oh, I'd say maybe 73, 75.


CC
Roger.


LMP
It's hard to tell at this density and pressure of gas, but comfort level is about the - about the same as the command module.


CC
You probably - -


LMP
It was a little warmer or stuffier when we first got in, but it seems to be improving.


CC
Houston copies. Out.


CC
11, Houston.


LMP
You may be able to see some - -


CC
Go ahead.


LMP
- - some particles jumping around on your screen. That's just dust particles that are being illuminated by Sun shafting in the window.


CC
Roger. They're very clear now. Over. And that's a good view of Neil's - correction, of Buzz's circuit breaker panel, there.


LMP
I can just barely see the handrail on the front porch from the position on the right-hand window.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. Our view of the Panel 11 is - gets brighter, then darker. Are you changing the f-stop at all? Over.







LMP
No, what's happening is, we get pretty close to the window now and then, and it drives the automatic light control into the stop, I think.


CC
I think that's right.


LMP
Yes, I had the switch on OUTSIDE while I was going through the overhead window. That may be what's contributing to some of it.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. We seem to be picking up a few more dust particles now. We see them quite clearly in the screen now. Over.


LMP
Yes, I'm choking on one every so often.


CC
11, Houston. Your show is going out to the U.S. now. We're about to get the satellite up. It'll be transmitted to some other countries after that. Over.


LMP
Roger. I'm checking out this window bracket where I'll be putting it for the EVA pictures of Neil going down the ladder.


CC
Roger.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We keep marveling about the color and the clarity of the picture. It's really difficult to describe. It's - It's just perfect. Over.


CC
And, 11, it doesn't look like you're having too much trouble with that bracket up there, Buzz.


LMP
I'll tell you, those new knobs really make it easy to twist the thing and get it cinched down quite tight.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. Buzz, how does the alignment look, there?


LMP
It looks pretty good, as well as I can tell without the gear extended. I can't get a real definitive answer, but you couldn't fix it any place to see much more out of the window without hand-holding it for the whole time.


CC
Roger. Looks like to us it's going to work real well.







LMP
Give it enough room to - Yes, I think so.


CC
Buzz, we see you putting your window guard in place there, and back up to the ISA now.


LMP
Houston, ask FAO if the 90-degree bracket isn't stowed in the Commander's stowage assembly.


CC
Stand by.


CC
11, Houston. Buzz, you still looking for that 90-degree bracket? Over.


CDR
Yes, he is looking for it now.


CC
Roger. We'll have a word for you in just a moment.


CDR
Our monitor shows pretty good, clear pictures from this angle. I already found the 90-degree bracket.


CC
Roger, Neil. It's really a super picture. We've got the ACA, your ACA, the picture of the throttle, the 90-degree bracket. We see your handles, and now over to the bracket.


LMP
That's about the position we'll be putting the camera in after the initial descent on the ladder, and it'll be taken 1 frame a second for most of the EVA.


CC
Houston copies. Out. That's a real good view of that camera.


LMP
Our monitor is a little bit wavy, so it's hard for us to tell when we're - when we've got a steady picture for you.


CC
11, we have no complaints at all. We don't see that waviness on our picture. It's just really great. Over.


LMP
Do the edges of the window look like straight lines to you?


CC
That's affirmative.


LMP
Okay. They don't in our monitor, and that leads us to make some corrections to the camera, which probably aren't required sometimes.







CC
Buzz, we have no complaints at all. It's a magnificent picture.


CC
What was that, Buzz, you're chasing now?


CDR
That was - That was me picking up some particles of paint that were floating through the air in front of the camera, there.


CC
Roger, Neil. We got it. It appears to us that Neil's about to check the Velcro mat, there.


CC
Okay, Buzz. We see the card up now.


LMP
Okay. For those of you that don't know, this is where we log most of our data for each of the LM maneuvers, and we have another card like this that the timeline book that is laid down on the table in front of the data display keyboard; and it's on this timeline that we have all our procedures. But we obviously have to hold these in place in zero g, so we make use of the Velcro patches on the back and on the table so we can attach these down here; and then we just turn the pages over when we go to new sequences in our timeline of procedures.


CC
Roger.


LMP
And we're ready to copy DOI PAD.


CC
Roger. We'll have the FIDO's work that one up for you momentarily.


CC
11, Houston. That was a good shot of Panel 2. Now we got Panel 3 in view with the TEMP MONITOR switch. The stabilization - station and control panel, we see now, with the MODE CONTROL switches. Now over to the rendezvous radar. Real good.


CC
11, that's real good camera work.


LMP
That'll be the most unusual position a cameraman's ever had, hanging by his toes from a tunnel and taking the picture upside-down.


CC
Roger. Well you're doing a super job. We got a good view of the cross pointer, there. Had a good view of the tape meter.







LMP
We're giving you a picture now of the floor of the cabin. I think you can see the - one of the two portable life support system backpacks here in the center, and on each side, we have the two helmet visors. I'll remove one of them and show you a little closer view of what this looks like.


CC
Roger.


LMP
Inside the helmet visors are the EVA gloves with the blue tips. I'm about to take those out now.


CC
Roger, Buzz. That's a great shot now that we're getting of the helmet, the EVA visor, and also the - the EVA gloves in the background.


LMP
Okay. You did say this was going out now, didn't you?


CC
Standby. I think so.


CC
11, you got a pretty big audience. It's live in the U.S. It's going live to Japan, western Europe, and much of South America. Everybody reports very good color. Appreciate the great show.


LMP
Roger. Understand. Thank you.


CC
Buzz, that was a good demonstration of your EVA visor assembly. Appreciate it.

CC
Hey, I like the good view of Mr. Collins down there. We finally see him again.


CMP
Hello there, earthling.

CC
Hello there.


CC
11, Houston. We noticed when you were scanning over Panel 2 a moment ago, 1 and 2, the two eight balls were slightly in disagreement. Control said he'd like a AGS align, there.


LMP
Yes. One of them's AGS, one of them's PNGCS. The problem is, we don't know whether to align AGS to PNGCS or PNGCS to AGS.


CC
Stand by.


CC
11, Chris said he can tell you.


LMP
We'll cage them both.


CC
Roger.


LMP
Like old home week, Charlie, to get back in the LM again.


CC
Roger. I can imagine.


CDR
The traverse from the bottom of the LM to the aft bulkhead of the command module must be about 16, 20 feet. It's not a disorienting one at all, but it's most interesting to contemplate just pushing off from one and bounding on into the other vehicle all the way through the tunnel.


CC
Roger. Must be some experience. Is Collins going to go in and look around?


CDR
We're willing to let him go but he hasn't come up with the price of the ticket yet.


02 08 38 O1        CC
Roger. I'd advise him to keep his hands off the switches.


CDR
If I can get him to keep his hands off my DSKY, it'd be a fair swap.


CC
Roger.







CMP
That's why I've been eating so much today. I haven't had anything to do. He won't let me touch it any more.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. If that's not the Earth, we're in trouble.


CDR
That's the Earth, and we have a very good view of it today. There are a few more cloud bands on than yesterday when we beamed down to you, but it's a beautiful sight.


CDR
We have some horizontal banding in our TV monitor. Are we transmitting that to you, or do you have a clear picture?


CC
Neil, we have a very clear picture. The only thing that we see is a little white dot in the bottom of our screen, which is - our TV guys say is an - apparently a burned out spot in the camera, but it should come back. Over.


CDR
Roger. We have that in our monitor also.


CC
11, Houston. We do have three lines across our TV. I thought it was just a transmission problem, but everybody's telling me now that it's probably - it's on the downlink. Over.


CDR
No, those are the same three ones that we have.


CC
Okay.


LMP
How far are - out are we now, Charlie?


CC
Stand by. Give you exact figure.


CDR
Did you notice the difference between yesterday and today? This is as large an image we can - we can give you.


CC
Roger. If you think we're smaller, you're now 177,000 miles out. Over.


LMP
Thank you.


CDR
That's nautical miles?


CC
That's affirmative, 11. We -


LMP
... Hold on.


CC
Go ahead. Over.







CC
11, Houston. We see the - still see the banding along the intratropical convergence. I guess the most predominate one now is around the - up in the - around the equator or slightly north of the equator.


LMP
Yes, that's the way it looks, Charlie. Same as yesterday.


CC
Roger.


LMP
Just keep the Pacific Ocean nice and clear and calm on splash day, is all we ask.


CDR
And Charlie, I'd like to say hello to all my fellow scouts and scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week; and Apollo 11 would like to send them best wishes.


CC
Thank you, Apollo 11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news, surely appreciate that.


CC
11, Houston. We have you - your subspacecraft point is just off the western coast of South America directly south of about Mexico City. Over.


CDR
That - That looks like what we observe from here.


CDR
And we're going to turn our TV monitor off now for a short bit while we have some other work to do. Apollo 11 signing off.


CC
Roger, 11. Thank you very much. That was one of the greatest shows we've ever seen. We sure appreciate it. Over.


CDR
It was a pleasure.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Could you give us an idea of about how long it will be before you start close - closing the LM back up? Over.


CDR
We've got a little more work to do up here, Charlie. We're going to make sure that we have everything transferred around and stowed the way we want it and try to get a little bit ahead on tomorrow's timeline. I suppose that we could be out of there in another half hour or so if it was necessary.







CC
Roger, Neil. We're not trying to push you. We're just trying to get an idea of - about water dumps and starting up the PTC again. Take your sweet time. Over.


CDR
Okay. We'd like to get a flight plan update from you for the next couple of hours, here. When you think what the various constraints might be and what - what order you might like us to do things.


CC
Roger. Stand by. We'll have that to you in a moment.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, we'd like to go ahead and do a waste-water dump. We'd like you to dump it all the way down to zero. Over.


CMP
Roger. We copy that, Charlie.


CMP
How does that work, Charlie?


CDR
Houston, 11.


CC
11, Houston. Did you call? Over.


CDR
Roger. Just noticed that the mast that the EVA light is on is charred brown. It looks as though it took quite a beating during launch.


CC
Roger.


CDR
The EVA light still does work.


CC
Roger. We'll let this - the SPAN guys look at this, and we'll be back with you with what we think. Over.


CDR
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. We were wondering, Neil, with your closing comment on the TV, if you were going to turn it off. It indicated that you might be considering turning it back on. We were wondering whether we want to keep the lines up. Over.


CDR
Well, we want your recommendation on that, but I think we would just as soon, ourselves, terminate the TV. But if you have a commitment to keep, we'd be more than willing to turn it back on.


CC
Roger. Stand by.







CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to terminate the TV. We don't - We think we got a really - a good tape. That hour and a half show was superb. And we'd like to pick up TV - correction - PTC at about 58 hours. Over.


CDR
Roger. PTC at 58 hours.


CC
And we'll have the remaining functions in the flight plan soon. Over.


CDR
Okay. Fine.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Our recommendations on the activities for the next hour or so, as far as flight plan goes, are: Continue your LM familiarization as desired until about 58 hours, then ingress to the CSM, close the hatch, and establish PTC shortly thereafter. Over.


CC
And, Apollo 11, Houston. Terminate the - -


LMP
Okay.


CC

LMP
Okay, Charlie. Thank you.

Roger, Houston. I'd like to do a P52 option 3 and tweak the platform up prior to starting the PTC. Over.


CC
Roger, 11. Stand by.


CC
11, Houston. That sounds like a good idea to us. Go ahead.


CMP
Okay. And the platform's looking pretty good to me. It looks like the worst axis drift is 0.01 something degrees per hour. Is that about what you figure?


CC
11, Roger. We've had reports all the marks have been good all the - the last couple of times you've run them. Just a moment; I'll get you some







information on the apparent drift rate.


CMP
Okay, Owen. Thank you. You got the maroons on?


CC
Say again, 11.


CMP
I say you got the maroons on now?


CC
Not permanently, Mike. Just have a stand-by here while Charlie's out checking how to use that special tool on the camera. The maroon team will be on tomorrow.


CMP
Okay. Nice to hear your voice. How's everything going?


CC
Everything's going smoothly here. We sure enjoyed the show this afternoon, Mike.


CMP
Okay.

LMP
Okay. Going there now.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have some updates and some things we'd like to talk to you about, if you aren't in the middle of your meal. If it's convenient anytime for you, we're ready with some updates. Over.


CDR
What - What are the updates going to apply to?


CC
Roger. We have a couple of changes on the LM mission rules NO GO for your NO GO card, Neil. One slight change on the APS/DPS fuel and TEMP pressure card, and we have a change to the procedure for the secondary radiator leak check, which is to be formed at - performed at 71 hours tomorrow, and also some indications that we have a couple of landing site obliques stowed in the wrong place. Over.


CDR
Okay. Is any of those in the flight plan? The secondary radiator, for example?


CC
That's affirmative. The secondary radiator leak check is called out in the flight plan at 71 20. That procedure is listed in your launch operations book on page 2 9, L2 9. We'd like to change that procedure. Over.


CDR
Okay. Stand by.


CMP
Charlie, on the secondary leak check, just read it verbatim like you want, and I'll copy directly into the flight plan and not fool around with the checklist.


CC
Roger. That's fine. If you're ready to copy, stand by.


CMP
Ready to copy on the leak check.


CC
Roger. It's monitor secondary accumulator quantity. Step 2 is secondary glycol to radiator valve, NORMAL for 30 seconds, then BYPASS. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity - Are you with me?


CMP
Yes, I'm with you.


CC
Okay. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump,







AC 1 or AC 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol discharge secondary pressure 39 to 51 psig. Also verify secondary EVAP out TEMP has changed. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump, OFF. Secondary glycol to radiator valve, BYPASS. That ends the procedure. Over.


CMP
Okay. I read back: monitor secondary accumulator quantity; secondary glycol radiator valve, NORMAL for 30 seconds, then to BYPASS. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Secondary coolant loop pump, AC 1 or 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol secondary discharge pressure 39 to 51 psig. Verify secondary evaporator outlet TEMP has changed. Secondary coolant loop pump, OFF. Secondary glycol radiator valve to BYPASS. And what's the reason for the change, Charlie?


CC
Roger. Stan is concerned that our present procedure as shown in the checklist does not really flow glycol through the radiator, and it - They want to verify that we do not have a plugged secondary radiator. Over.


CMP
Okay. They have any abnormal indications in that system, so far?


CC
Negative. This is the procedure that they came up with. It's just a check, Mike. Everything's looking great to us. Over.


CMP
Okay. Fine.


CDR
Charlie, we'll get back with you on these other changes in a few minutes. Okay?


CC
Roger, Neil. No hurry. Over.

Okay.







CMP
Because it's a special occasion today, Houston. This is the third anniversary of Gemini 10.


CC
Roger. Happy anniversary.


CMP
Thank you, sir.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy your update.


CC
Roger. Stand by.


CC
Okay, Buzz. The first item is that we have indications that your landing site obliques are not in the proper position. If you'll check, we think that the intermediate scale landing site oblique is stowed in the CSM lunar landmark book. We think that the large scale landing site oblique is stowed in the back of the LM lunar surface map book. Over.


LMP
I think I heard you Charlie, but I'm not sure that I understand.


CC
Roger. According to our stowage list the - the landing site oblique should be in the transfer bag. In - But in the backup set of data, the intermediate scale oblique is in the CSM lunar landmark book, and the large scale oblique is in the back of the LM lunar surface map book; and that's the reason we think that they might be not where you think they are. Over.


LMP
Okay. We've got three obliques. The last one is one I asked for recently. It's just a blow up of the second one. The first one is one that's got dotted lines on it, indicating horizon view and 50-degree LPD; and all three of those are in the transfer book. Over.


CC
Roger. Fine. We were wrong in our - in our backup set. We had those out of place. Looks like the onboard data's good. We just wanted to let you check on that one. We have an update on the APS/DPS fuel card that you place on the panel. It's a typo error. If you'll break out that little card, we've got the - correct that typo error. Over.


LMP
Stand by.


LMP
Okay. I got it.







CC
Roger, Buzz. Under the DPS column on the pressure side, you go down to the fourth item, says pressure greater than 150 PTCA should be greater than 65 percent. Over.


LMP
Okay. That's greater than 1.8 but less than 65 and greater than 150 for greater than 65.


CC
That's affirmative. Out.


CC
And we have three items on the mission rules NO-GO card, if you're ready to copy those. Over.


LMP
Okay. I've got the mission rules NO-GO.


02 ll 24 34        CC
Roger, Buzz. First entry's on the EPS under AC bus A. The line extends all the way to high gate. Actually, the line should read - at DOI it would be NO-GO AC bus A. After that the NO-GO would be both buses. So if you will just pencil in both buses from PDI through high gate, it'll be correct for that line. Over.


LMP
Okay. I've got that: AC bus A for DOI and both buses NO-GO for PDI on.


CC
That's affirmative up until high gate. You can stop at the line in front of the column "5 minutes to low gate". Now the next line is under the G&amp;C PGNS, pitch and roll GDA's. You can scratch that line completely. Over.


LMP
Roger. Got it.


CC
Okay, Buzz. Last entry is down under RCS, and it's a typo error under the three - in the line "three axis attitude control". If you proceed to the right at PDI plus 05, you'll see one axis. The line goes all the way to low gate to touchdown. That's incorrect. The line should stop under "5 minutes to low gate". Over.


LMP
Okay. We're stopping that at "5 minutes to low gate".


CC
That's affirmative. That completes that card. The rest of the updates are just really for your information based on our 58 hour platform - look at the platform. We are really good shape. Your GYRO's have almost no drift in them since - plotted update we were looking at X of a minus 2.24 ...







Y of point plus 0.87, Z of minus 0.11. Since the update, which was based on the 52 hour P52, I believe, we gave you an X drift of plus 0.79, yaw of plus 1.06, Z of plus 0.02 ... I can see the difference between the 52 hour and the 57 hour alignments were - did not really give us enough time to get a real good or completely valid update on the drift check. So we're real satisfied with the way the GYRO's are looking. The PIPA's are looking great also. We are in real good shape with those, too. Over.


CDR
This is Apollo 11. Radio check.


CC
Roger. Reading you five by. How me? Over.


CDR
Okay. Loud and clear. You cut out when you were talking about the platform - something about 52 hours and after that, we never heard you again.


CC
Roger. Guess we were changing antennas. Stand by. That's affirmative, 11. We were swapping antennas on you down here. Basically the word is that we have a real good platform, very small drift on the GYRO's, and very small drift in the PIPA's. Over.


CDR
Roger. Thank you. And I would like to have a few words of clarification if you will give them to me on the RCS ... what that change of pitch may mean.


CC
Copy. A few words of clarification on the RCS? Oh. Roger. The update there, Neil, you are speaking of about the one axis down to 5 minutes of low gate?


CDR
Yes. That's right. I'm not quite sure what that ... means beyond 5 minutes.


CC
Stand by. I'll make sure I got my story straight with Control. Stand by.


CDR
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. On the RCS, what we are saying is that if we lose control about one axis prior to low gate, we would recommend an abort. This would require a - a loss of - of two distinct jets which is not very probable, but that is what we are recommending. After low gate we would continue on. We would recommend that we continue on to attempt a landing. Over.







CDR
Roger. I think I ...


CC
Roger.


CMP
Charlie, did you say you had some updates for me from the lunar surface book?


CC
Apollo 11, say again. You were cut out. Over.


CMP
Roger. Did you say you had some updates for us in the lunar surface book. Over.


CC
Negative. At this time, we do not have any updates for the lunar surface book. We wanted you to have it just in case. Over.

Roger. You were cut out that time.


CC
Roger. At the present time, we do not have any updates for you on the lunar surface book. We are thinking about some and kicking them around, but they're very minor changes. Over.


CC
11, Houston. Did you copy that transmission?


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We swapped antennas on you again. I say again that we do not have any lunar surface update - book updates at this time. We're considering a few minor ones, but we're still kicking them around the MOCR. Over.

I didn't understand that. Say again.


CC

Apollo 11, Houston. We don't see any time constraint. We'd like you to go ahead and set up the wide deadband and then go through step 10 and 11. Over.


CMP
Okay. Will do. I don't see any constraint here, Charlie. I was just checking to make sure, because last time, I went from 8 to 9 to 10 to 11 a little bit more swiftly than I'd been doing in the past.


CC

Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on Bravo?


CC
Roger. Reading you five-by.

Houston, Apollo 11. How's the PTC looking?


CC
Stand by.


CC
11, Houston. The PTC looks great to us. Over.


CMP
Hey, do you have any idea what happened to the previous one?


CC
We have absolutely no idea. Over.


CMP
Okay. Did, it look like it was all right, then just all of a sudden start diverging?


CC
That's negative, Mike. If you'll look at the plot, which we'll save for you and let you see it postflight, it started off immediately on the first REV and just spiraled out to about - oh 20 to - 20 degrees in pitch, and then it seemed to be setting up a spiral around an offset pitch point of about 20 degrees off from 90 degrees; but we didn't want to take a chance that it would become stable at that point. We thought it might diverge, and so we called you and started over again. Over.







CMP
Okay, no complaints. I was just curious as to what had happened.

Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


LMP
Good morning again, Houston. Apollo 11.


CC
Roger 11. Good morning. When you - -


LMP
Would you like the O2 purge this morning?


CC
Yes indeed. O2 fuel cell purge at 71 hours, and when you feel like copying, I've got a flight plan update containing - I guess that and some other items for you.


CDR
Okay. Stand by.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead with the flight plan update.


CC
Roger, 11. This is Houston. At approximately 71 hours to 72 hours, we have you down for an eat period which I imagine is probably in progress already. 71 hours: O2 fuel cell purge; 72 hours GET: CO2 filter change number 6, secondary radiator flow check. And we'll send you up a P37 block data on a 2 hour pass, pericynthion pass, return mode abort. At 73 hours 00 minutes: stop PTC at approximately 0 degrees roll. That is, when you're ccming up on 0 degrees roll angle around 73 hours, we'd like you to stop PTC. And perform a P52 option 3 remaining in the PTC REFSMMAT for a drift check. 73 hours, 20 minutes: we'll give you a P27 update to the landing site REFSMMAT, LOI 1 state vector, and target load. 73 hours 30 minutes: maneuver to 000 roll, pitch, and yaw; high gain antenna angles will be pitch 0, yaw 335; and perform a P52 option 1 using the new landing site REFSMMAT. Resume the nominal flight plan at 74 hours GET. Over.


LMP
Okay. We'll get started on the fuel cell purge while we're eating. CO2 canister change number 6; secondary radiator flow check; copy some pads. Also at 72 hours, stop PTC 0 roll at 73; do a P52 option 3; we'll get your uplink REFSMMAT for the landing site; and at 000 - let's see, now was this with the old REFSMMAT or the new REFSMMAT?







CC
This is with the - -

Roger, 11. Correction on my last. At 73 20, we uplink you the new REFSMMAT. And at 73 30, we'd like you to maneuver to 0 roll, 0 pitch, 0 yaw in the old REFSMMAT. And then torque around to the new REFSMMAT and run your P52 option 1 in that same inertial attitude. Over.


CMP
Roger, Understand.


CC
I've got consumables update, when you're ready to copy.


CMP
I just got up, but you didn't catch me on that one.


CC
I say I have one for you.


CMP
Okay. We're ready to copy that consumable update.

Roger. 7.5 for each. Over.


LMP
Negative. LMP 6.5.


CC
Roger. 7.5, 7.5 and 6.5. And I got a few words for you here on the SPS engine performance. Over.


LMP
Okay. We're ready to listen.


CC
Okay, 11. It turns out that the engine performance during both of your burns so far this mission has been the same as it was on engine acceptance tests. The onboard PC reading is due to a known gage calibration factor between what you've actually got in the chamber and what you're reading out on the gage. We expect single bank operation to be 90 - that is, 90 psi on the gage with an actual chamber pressure of 95 psi. In dual bank operation, the chamber pressure is 94 psi on the gage with an actual of 99 psi. 80 psi on the gage on board correlates to 83 psi actual. And we recommend that you stick to an LOI termination cue of 80 psi on the gage. That is, no change to the mission rules. Over.


CDR
Apollo 11. Roger. We got all that.


CC
Houston. Out.

CDR
Houston, do you read Apollo 11?


CC
Roger, 11. We're reading you loud and clear now. We were down in the noise as we switched antennas a minute or so ago. Over.


CMP
Roger. What sort of settings could you recommend for the solar corona? We've got the Sun right behind the edge of the Moon now.


CC
Roger.


LMP
It's quite an erie sight. There is a very marked three dimensional aspect of having the Sun's corona coming from behind the Moon the way it is.


CC
Roger.


LMP
And it looks as though - I guess what's giving it that three dimensional effect is the earthshine. I can see Tycho fairly clearly - at least if I'm right side up, I believe it's Tycho, in moonshine - I mean, in earthshine. And, of course, I can see the sky is lit all the way around the Moon, even on the limb of it where there's no earthshine or sunshine.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


LMP
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. If you'd like to take some pictures, we recommend using magazine Uniform which is loaded with high speed black and white film, interior lights off, electric Hasselblad with the 80 millimeter lens. And you're going to have to hand hold us, I guess. We're recommending an f stop of 2.8, and we'd like to get a sequence of time exposures. Over.


LMP
Okay. You want magazine Uniform instead of magazine Tango? Over.


CC
Roger. We're not trying to get you all wrapped up in a procedure here. This is on a not to interfere basis, of course. Over.


LMP
Okay.


CC
And on the exposures we're looking for an eighth of a second, a half a second. And, if you think you can steady the camera against anything to get longer exposures, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds. Over.


LMP
Roger. We copy.







CC
Roger. Out.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.


CMP
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. We'd like to do a little CRYO tank balancing. So, if you could position the oxygen tank number 1 heater switch to OFF and hydrogen tank 2 heater switch to OFF leaving all the rest of the CRY0 switches the same, we'll let it run that way for a few hours. Over.


CMP
Okay. Stand by one on those switches. We'll get them in a minute.


CC
Roger. And how far out can you see the corona extending? Over.


CDR
... bit like zodiacal light. It keeps going out farther and farther. We'll talk about it a little more later.


CC
Roger. Out.


CDR
... We've got quite a few pictures ...


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. I think we have COMM again. We heard you calling. Over.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Were you calling? Over.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Understand you want the heaters OFF for hydrogen tank 1 and oxygen tank 1. Is that affirmative?


CC
That's negative, Mike. Hydrogen tank number 2 heaters OFF and oxygen tank number 1 heaters OFF.


CMP
Okay.


CC
Roger. Out.


CMP
I have hydrogen tank number 2 heaters OFF; I have oxygen tank number 1 heaters OFF.


CC
Roger. Out.


CMP
Houston. Apollo 11. The earthshine coming through the window is so bright you can read a book by it.







CC
Oh, very good.


CDR
And, Houston, I'd suggest that along the ecliptic line we can see the corona light out to two lunar diameters from this location. The bright light only extends out about an eighth to a quarter of the lunar radius.


CC
Roger. Understand that you can see the corona approximately 200 solar diameters out along the ecliptic, and the bright light extends out approximately one eighth to one quarter lunar radius. Over.


CDR
That's two lunar - two lunar diameters along the ecliptic in the bright part, right; a quarter to an eighth of a lunar radius out, and that's perpendicular to the ecliptic line on the South Pole.


CC
Roger.


CDR
Houston, it's been a real change for us. Now we are able to see stars again and recognize constellations for the first time on the trip. It's - the sky is full of stars. Just like the nightside of Earth. But all the way here, we have only been able to see stars occasionally and perhaps through the monocular, but not recognize any star patterns.


CC
I guess it has turned into night up there really, hasn't it ?


CDR
Really has.


CC
11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.


CDR
Okay. We went to HIGH GAIN. Looks like you had a little trouble getting signal strength there.


CC
Roger. We missed an 0MNI switch there. Over.


CDR
All right. On the secondary loop check when we went to FLOW on the secondary radiators, the quantity dropped from 40 percent down to 36 in the first 10 seconds and then stabilized at 36 for the remainder of the 30 seconds.







CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We believe that is normal system operation. The radiators are expected to be very cold right now and apparently the decrease you saw was due to contraction in the fluid. Over.


CDR
Okay. We will go ahead with the procedure just as if there were no decrease in accumulator quantity. Right?


CC
Roger. Press on.


END OF TAPE



APOLLO 11 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION




CDR
And, Houston, the secondary radiator flow check is complete and satisfactory.


CC
Houston. Roger. Out.


CMP
And that's a good deal because we don't have to have any meetings about whether we're going to do it or don't do it any more.

The Flight Director says "ouch."


CMP
No. No "ouch" intended. I enjoyed every one of those meetings.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you have a minute or so free, we can read you up the morning news here.


CDR
Go right ahead; let's hear it.


CC
Roger. Hot from the wires of the MSC Public Affairs Office, especially prepared for the crew of Apollo 11.


CC
Okay. First off, it looks like it's going to be impossible to get away from the fact that you guys are dominating all the news back here on Earth. Even Pravda in Russia is headlining the







mission and calls Neil, "The Czar of the Ship." I think maybe they got the wrong mission.


CC
West Germany has declared Monday to be "Apollo Day." School children in Bavaria have been given the day off. Post Office clerks have been encouraged to bring radios to work and Frankfurt is installing TV sets in public places.


CC
BBC in London is considering a special radio alarm system to call people to their TV sets in case there is a change in the EVA time on the Moon.


CC
And in Italy, Pope Paul VI has arranged for a special color TV circuit at his summer residence in order to watch you, even though Italian television is still black and white.


CC
Back here in Houston, your three wives and children got together for lunch yesterday at Buzz's house. And according to Pat, it turned out to be a gabfest. The children swam and did some high jumping over at Buzz's bamboo pole.


CC
In Moscow, space engineer Anatol Koritsky was quoted by TASS as saying that Luna 15 could accomplish everything that has been done by earlier Luna spacecraft. This was taken by the press to mean Luna 15 could investigate the gravitational fields, photograph the Moon, and go down to the surface to scoop up a bit for analysis.


CC
Even the kids at camp got into the news when Mike Jr. was quoted as replying "yeah" when somebody asked him if his daddy was going to be in history. Then after a short pause he asked, "What is history?" In Washington, President Nixon is planning to use his executive power to streamline the Interstate Commerce Commission. According to industry sources, it was reported Nixon would trim the commission from 11 to 7 members by not making new appointments.


CC
And the big news around Houston today concerns the Astros. In the sports world, the Houston Astros rallied in the ninth inning at Cincinnati to dump the Reds 7 to 4. Going into the ninth however, things looked pretty bleak. The Astros were trailing 4 to 3. Then with one out, Jesus Alou stroked a single to right field. John







Edwards hit another single to right, and Sandy Valdespino hit a double to bring in the tying run. Julio Gotay was walked and Joe Morgan dropped a bunt for the game winning play. A wild throw to the plate allowed another run to score, then a sacrifice fly by Dennis Menke brought in the final run. They really came through in the ninth.


CC
And other games in the National League - -


CMP
Yes. Those Astros have really been catching those flies since they put a roof on the stadium.


CC
Good work.


CC
In other games in the National League, New York beat Montreal 5 to 2; Pittsburgh beat St. Louis 4 to 1; and Atlanta over San Diego in the first game of a double header 6 to 2.


CC
In the American League, Detroit beat Cleveland 4 to nothing; New York trounced Washington 5 to nothing; Baltimore outhit - Boston outhit Baltimore to score 6 runs to the Orioles' 2; and Chicago beat Kansas City 6 to 1.


CC
Okay. In golf world, Tommy Jacobs, an infrequent competitor in recent years, took the lead in the Philadelphia Golf Classic yesterday. His second round score was 139.


CC
You might be interested in knowing, since you are already on the way, that a Houston astrologer, Ruby Graham, says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. She says that Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses, but he is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also suppose to have "intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling." Buzz is to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know at what hour Mike was born, she has decided that he either has the same attributes as Neil or he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative.







CC
And last but not - -


CMP
Who said all that?


CC
(Laughter) Ruby Graham, an astrologer here in Houston. Now we check with Flight Operations for all the signs for the mission, and then we, of course, had to make sure that everything was really all set.


CDR
Houston, 11. You're cutting out ...


CC
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're switching 0MNI's. Can you stand by for about 2 minutes?


CDR
Houston, 11. Radio check.


CC
11, Houston. Go ahead.


CDR
Roger. You cut out after Tommy Jacobs. I guess we got into antenna switching problems.


CC
Okay. Following Tommy Jacobs, we have the hot smoking word from a local Houston astrologer by the name of Ruby Graham. She says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses but is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also supposed to have "intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling," Buzz is supposed to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know at what hour Mike was born, she decided he either has the same attributes as Neil or that he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative. And that's 30 for today. Over.

Thank you much there, Bruce and Fred Show, we appreciate that.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Did you hear our comment about the Astros?


CC
The one about the roof?







CMP
Yes.


CC
Hey, Mike, the game was at Cincinnati there, and we think that they're still using Crosby Field up there. I don't believe it has a roof on it.


CDR
You got him on that one.


CC
Right - -


CDR
I think they're just getting to be a good team in the clinch.

CDR
Stand by.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. The next time we pass through roll 0, we're going to stop PTC and that will give us 90 degrees pitch. Now, I understand you want us to move from 90 degrees pitch to 0 degrees pitch for the platform align, option 1. Is that affirmative?


CC
Standby, please.


CDR
And we are ready to copy on the LOI 1.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. When you stop at 0 roll, you will be in approximately 90 pitch, 0 yaw, and 0 roll. We'd like you to run the







first P52, that is, the P52 option 3, from that attitude. Then we'll uplink you a new REFSMMAT, either before or while you are maneuvering to 000, and then you can torque the platform around and run the second REFSMMAT. Over. Run the second P52. Over.

The view of the Moon that we've been having recently is really spectacular. It fills about three quarters of the hatch window, and of course, we can see the entire circumference, even though part of it is in complete shadow and part of it's in earthshine. It's a view worth the price of the trip.

We're doing this in advance of LOI in order to insure that you don't have any destratification as a result of the burn, which might result in giving you a master caution and warning during the burn. Over.







LMP
Okay. Was that 74 30? You want us to cycle the heaters and turn - cycle the fans and turn all the heaters on.

CDR
Can you give us a couple of pointing angles?

CDR
Everything looks good up here.


CDR
Apollo 11 is getting its first view of the landing approach. This time we are going over the Taruntius crater, and the pictures and maps brought back by Apollo 8 and 10 have given us a very good preview of what to look at here. It looks very much like the pictures, but like the difference between watching a real football game and watching it on TV. There's no substitute for actually being here.


CC
Roger. We concur, and we surely wish we could see it firsthand, also.







LMP
We're going over the Messier series of craters right at the time, looking vertically down on them, and Messier A we can see good sized blocks in the bottom of the crater. I don't know what our altitude is now, but in any case, those are pretty good size blocks.

11, Houston. During your SPS burn as played back on tape down here, we've observed the nitrogen tank Bravo pressure in the SPS system dropping a little bit more than we anticipated. It's holding steady right now. We'll continue to watch it and keep you posted if anything comes up. Over.


CDR
Roger. Thank you.


CC
Right. And it has held steady - -


CDR
Currently going over Maskelyne Mas -


CDR
Okay.


CDR
And Boothill, Duke Island, Sidewinder, looking at Maskelyne W, that's the yaw round checkpoint, and just coming into the terminator. At the terminator it's ashen and gray. As you get further away from the terminator, it gets to be







a lighter gray, and as you get closer to the subsolar point, you can definitely see browns and tans on the ground, according to the last Apollo 11 observation anyway.


CC
Roger, 11. We're recording your comments for posterity.


CDR
(Laughter) Okay.


CMP
Did somebody in the background - do they accuse us of being compromisers? Huh!


CDR
And landing site is well into the dark here. I don't think we're going to be able to see anything of the landing site this early.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. When you have a free minute, could you give us your onboard readout of N2 tank Bravo, please. And we'd like to make sure you understand that ever since you stopped thrusting with the SPS, the temperature in this tank has remained steady. Over. Make that the pressure has remained steady.


CMP
Roger. We understand tank pressure has stayed steady. Thank you.


LMP

APOLLO 11 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION




LMP
No, that's fine. I just wanted to confirm that. Until 79 10, then we'll breeze around here in orbit.


CC
Roger. And we've got an observation you can make if you have some time up there. There's been some lunar transient events reported in the vicinity of Aristarchus. Over.


LMP
Roger. We just went into spacecraft darkness. Until then, why, we couldn't see a thing down below us. But now, with earthshine, the visibility is pretty fair. Looking back behind me, now, I can see the corona from where the Sun has just set. And we'll get out the map and see what we can find around Aristarchus


CDR
We're coming upon Aristarchus right now - -


CC
- - Okay. Aristarchus is at angle Echo 9 on your ATO chart. It's about 394 miles north of track. However, at your present altitude, which is about 167 nautical miles, it ought to be over - that is within view of your horizon: 23 degrees north, 47 west. Take a look and see if you see anything worth noting up there. Over.


CDR
Both looking.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP
Houston, 11. It might help us a little bit if you could give us a time of crossing of 45 west.


 CC
Say again, please, 11.


LMP
You might give us a time of crossing of 45 west, and then we'll know when to start searching for Aristarchus.


CC
Roger. You'll be crossing 45 west at 77 04 10 or about 40 seconds from now. Over. Thirty seconds from now.


LMP
Okay.


CC
Apollo 11, when we lose the S-band, we'd like to get 0MNI Charlie from you. And update my last, that 77 04 was the time when Aristarchus should







become visible over your horizon. 77 12 is point of closest approach south of it. Over.


LMP
Okay. That sounds better because we just went by Copernicus a little bit ago.


CC
Roger. We show you at about 27 degrees longitude right now.


LMP
Righto.


LMP
Houston, when a star sets up here, there's no doubt about it. One instant it's there, and the next instant it's just completely gone.


CC
Roger. We copy.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We request you use OMNI Charlie at this time. Over.


LMP
Okay. Going to OMNI Charlie.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.


LMP
Roger. Seems to me since we know orbits so precisely, and know where the stars are so precisely, and the time of setting of a star or a planet to so very fine a degree, that this might be a pretty good means of measuring the altitude of the horizon ...


CC
Roger.


CMP
Hey, Houston. I'm looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and I can't really tell at that distance whether I am really looking at Aristarchus, but there's an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It just has - seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence to it. A crater can be seen, and the area around the crater is quite bright.


CC
Roger, 11. We copy.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Looking up at the same area now and it does seem to be reflecting some of the earthshine. I'm not sure whether it was worked







out to be about zero phase to - Well, at least there is one wall of the crater that seems to be more illuminated than the others, and that one - if we are lining up with the Earth correctly, does seem to put it about at zero phase. That area is definitely lighter than anything else that I could see out this window. I am not sure that I am really identifying any phosphorescence, but that definitely is lighter than anything else in the neighborhood.


CC
11, this is Houston. Can you discern any difference in color of the illumination, and is that an inner or an outer wall from the crater? Over.


CMP
Roger. That's an inner wall of the crater.


LMP
No, there doesn't appear to be any color involved in it, Bruce.


CC
Roger. You said inner wall. Would that be the inner edge of the northern surface?


CMP
I guess it would be the inner edge of the westnorthwest part, the part that would be more nearly normal if you were looking at it from the Earth.


CC
11, Houston. Have you used the monocular on this? Over.


LMP
Stand by one.


LMP
Roger. Like you to know this quest for science has caused me to lose my E memory program, it's in here somewhere, but I can't find it.


CC
11, this is Houston. We're - we're hearing only a partial COMM. Say again please.


CDR
I think ...


CDR
Houston, we will give it a try if we have the opportunity on next - when we are not in the middle of lunch, and trying to find the monocular.


CC
Roger. Copied you that time. Expect in the next REV you will probably be getting ready for LOI 2.


CC
So, let's wind this up, and since we've got some other things to talk to you about in a few minutes. Over.







LMP
Okay.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


CMP
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
11, this is Houston. We're targeting - planning to make the LOI 2 burn now using bank A only. We'll have the PAD and everything for you next time around. Just trying to economise a little on bank B. Bank B is holding, though.


CMP
Roger. Understand.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


CDR
Go ahead.


CC
11, Houston. In order to improve the communications a little bit here, we'd like to try to get you on the high gain antenna. We're recommending a pitch angle of 0, yaw 355 - I say again 355, the track switch to MANUAL, and wide beamwidth. Over.


CDR
Okay. You ready to switch to high gain now?


CC
That's affirmative.


CC
11, Houston. Do you read?


CDR
Roger. We read you. It seems to be rather marginal on the high gain.


CC
Roger. We concur.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you give us a time of crossing the prime meridian 150 west? Over.


CC
Roger. Stand by about a half a second, here. Okay. Your time of crossing the 150 west meridian will be 77 50 05. Over.


LMP
Thank you.







CC
11, this is Houston. We have about 6 minutes remaining until LOS, and in order that we may configure our ground lines, we'd like to know if you're still planning to have the TV up with the beginning of the next pass. Over.


CDR
Roger, Houston. We'll try to have it ready.


CC
This is Houston. We are inquiring if it is your plan to. Over.


CDF
It never was our plan to; but it's in the flight plan, so I guess we'll do it.


CC
Houston. Roger. Out.


CC
11, Houston.


CMP

Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.







LMP
This is Apollo 11. Are you picking up our signals okay?


03 06 24 l3        CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Affirmative. We are reading you loud and clear on voice and we have a good clear TV picture, a little bright crater in the - -


LMP
- - No, no, no - -


CC
- - the bottom of the picture. I guess that's the spot on the tube.


LMP
I'm sorry about that one.


CC
And if you give us P00 and ACCEPT, we will uplink our new state vector and target load to you.


CMP
Okay.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. One of the larger craters on the back side - I noticed a small, dark speck on the outer wall and I put the monocular on it. I was able to see - oh, an area maybe a quarter of a mile in diameter. It was really a freshlooking dark colored pit, and that seems to be in contrast with all the other fresh little craters or holes that you can perceive on the walls of any of these craters. Around this particular one there seems to be two or three of these - especially the one that caught my attention. Quite remarkable. Over.


CC
Roger. Do you have a location on that one?


LMP
No, not a precise one. I've got several pictures of it, though.


CC
Roger. We copy.


CC
We're getting a beautiful picture in down there now, 11. The color's coming in quite clearly, and we can see the horizon and the relative blackness of space, and without getting into the question of grays and browns, it looks, at least on our monitor, sort of a brownish gray.


LMP
That's a good, reasonable way of describing it. It appears to me as though it made a difference just sitting back in the tunnel and gazing at all windows; it makes a difference which one you're looking out of. For example, the camera







right now is looking out the number 5 window, and it definitely gives a rosier or tanner tinge, especially when you look straight through it and not at an angle. Over.


CC
Roger.


LMP
And if you rear back 95 or 100 degrees ...


MS
... Still holding ... Okay.


CC
Say again, 11?


LMP
I'd say we're about 95 degrees east, coming up on Smyth's Sea.


CC
Roger. And for your information, we show you at an altitude of about 92 miles above the surface right now.


LMP
Okay.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you observe a difference in the N2 pressures before LOI? It seems to me as though the two were not equal on the ... B tank was a little low on pressure. Over.


CMP
I'm flying it in SPS minimum impulse, Houston, and it's rather difficult to keep it on a constant data. The LM wants to wander up and down. I'm not sure if it's in response to MASCONN's or what, but I can get it completely stabilized in DATA and let it alone, and in another couple of minutes it will have developed its own rate.


CC
This is Houston. Roger.


CMP
Houston, we'll be moving shortly from the side window to the hatch window, and we'll try and pick up some of the landmarks that we'll be looking at as we approach the powered descent. Over.


CC
11, this is Houston. Roger. And we're through with the uplinks; the computer is yours. You can go to BLOCK and we'll have the information on nitrogen for you shortly. Over.


CMP
Roger. Copy.


LMP
Okay, Houston. Several minutes ago I was exactly steady on data, and since then I have been moving







toward the LM, pointed straight down toward the radius vector, and that's been despite a number of down minimum pitch impulses.


CC
Roger.

We're over Smyth's Sea right now.

We're about 88 degrees east, I would estimate.

Smyth Sea doesn't look much like a sea. It - The area which is devoid of craters, of which there's not very much, is sort of a hilly looking area. It's not like the maria at all.


CC
Roger. We copy that about the sea, and it looks like you were just giving us a view of the crater Neper, the large crater on the left, and Jansky on the right.


CMP
We think you're close, but no cigar.


CC
11, this is Houston. Would you care to comment on some of these craters as we go by?


CDR
Roger. We're approaching the approach path to ignition. This is equivalent to 13 minutes before ignition, and we're at about 83 degrees, I guess - 83 degrees east. That correspond to location you're holding there presently?

CMP
Hey, you should be looking back at Smyth Sea now.


CC
Roger.

Houston, what you're seeing in the middle of the screen now is the crater Schubert and Gilbert U is in the center right now; and this comes up at about - a little over 12 minutes before power decent. Instead of me looking - Instead of looking back at it, we'd be looking straight down at it in descent.


CC
Roger.


CC
And we show you at an altitude now of about 110 miles; and, of course, you'll be considerably lower at the initiation of powered descent.







CMP
Okay, Houston. Look at register 3 on the DSKY data. This data is increasing toward my desired of 315; and I'll let the hand controller alone here, and I'll bet you it reverses itself.


CC
Roger, 11. We're watching the DSKY now, and it's still coming in beautifully on the TV.


LMP
Okay. There's - on the right side of the screen at the present time, there's a triple crater with - with a small crater between the first and second; and the one at the bottom of the screen is Schubert Y. Zoom in; it does have a central peak in Schubert Y. Actually, several of them, and you can observe those plus the rim craters at the bottom of your screen.


CC
Roger. We're seeing the central peak quite clearly now.


LMP
Okay. We're zooming in now on a crater called Schubert N. Schubert N, very conical inside walls and the bottom appears to be nearly flat.


CMP
Look at data on the DSKY. It's stabilized and is holding steady now.


CC
Roger.


LMP
Looking out the window I can see a number of small craters on the bottom of Schubert N.


CMP
We're coming up on the Foaming Sea where I'll be doing some P22 marking on a crater of my choice, name of crater, Camp.


CC
Okay. We'll be watching for Neper.

Okay. We've observed the behavior of your DSKY, and I think we've got the data here to work on it. Let us grind around a little while on it, and we'll report back to you, probably in a REV or two.


CMP
Okay. Well, in the meantime, I'm going to pitch down toward 315.


CC
Roger.


LMP
Three craters - three horizontal craters that you now have in the field of view are immediately underneath the ground track. The right hand is the largest crater that you see, Dubiago P.


CC
Roger. We concur on the identification of that crater.


CC
And we show you coming up on landmark Alfa 1 here shortly.


LMP
Roger. Mike's having his first look at Alfa 1 at the present time.


CMP
Yea. It's a very bright crater. It's not a large one but an extremely bright one. It looks like a very recent and, I would guess, impact crater with rays streaming out in all directions which should make my - Correction - the Foaming Sea easy to see coming up on it now. Crater Camp is one of the smaller ones out on the - on the floor of the Foaming Sea.

Here we show you over the Sea of Fertility now, and we ought to have Langrenus down south of track a few degrees, about 9 degrees south of track.







LMP
Now the crater that's in the center of the screen now is Webb. We'd be looking straight down on it at about 6 minutes before power descent. It has a relatively flat bottom to the crater, and you can see maybe two or three craters that are in the bottom of it on the western wall, the wall that's now nearest the - the camera. Near the bottom of the screen, we can see a dimple crater, just on the outside. And then coming back toward the bottom of the screen and to the left, you can see a series of depressions. It's this type of connected craters that give us most interest to discover why they're in the particular pattern that they're in. I'll zoom the camera in now and try and give you a closer look at it.


CC
Roger. We're observing the dimple crater now. The central peak we can see on the Orbiter photos doesn't seem to stand out very well here.


LMP
Well, they're not central peaks. They're depressions in the center.


CC
Roger.


CMP
And you'll notice on the pitch thruster activity, I've still - I've put in a dozen mininum impulses in pitchdown, and I'm still far from correcting back to 315.


LMP
We're moving the camera over to the right window now to give you Langrenus, its - its several central peaks and -


CC
Roger. We got Langrenus in our screen now.


CC
Okay, 11. This is Houston. We're getting a beautiful picture of Langrenus now with its rather conspicuous central peak.


CMP
The Sea of Fertility doesn't look very fertile to me. I don't know who named it.


CDR
Well, it may have been named by a gentleman whom this crater was named after, Langrenus. Langrenus was a cartographer to the King of Spain and made one of the - one of the early reasonably accurate maps of the Moon.


CC
Roger. That's very interesting - -







CDR
... at least it sounds better for our purposes than the Sea of Crises.


CC
Amen to that.


CC
Okay. It looks like you're coming inside now on the camera.


LMP
Well, I can't get behind to see the monitor. I'll bring the focus in, but we're going to be looking down past one of the LM quads and one of the antennas almost straight down at the ground track that we'll be seeing coming in now. I guess there's maybe 2 or 3 minutes before power descent.


LMP
All right, that should put the LM structure about in focus, and I'm going to move it out to infinity and then expand the field of view.


LMP
Crater Secchi is out my window now, window number 2.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. This is Houston. We show you coming up on the terminator at 78 53, about 7 minutes from now, and we've also got the LOI 2 and TEI 5 PAD's ready for you after the TV whenever you want to terminate. Over.


LMP
Roger.


CC
And we're getting a good view of the track leading into the landing site now and -


CC
Okay, And it looks like we got Secchi K, went by about 10 seconds ago; coming up on Apollo Ridge.


CC
And in the right hand portion of our screen right now, we can see Messier Alfa and Bravo with the light colored rays streaming off in one direction.


LMP
I don't know if you can make out, but in the Sea of Fertility there are a number of craters that are just barely discernible, old, old craters whose outlines are just barely able to be seen.







CC
Roger. I think we can make them out. The color really enhances our ability to discern features and craters over what we see in real time on our black and white monitor.


LMP
Right. The - At these low Sun angles, there's no trace of brown, it's now returned to a very gray appearance and, like the 8 crew says, it has a look of plaster of paris to it at this Sun angle, which is completely lacking in ...


CC
Roger.


LMP
Okay. This is very close to ignition point for power descent. Just passing Mount Marilyn that - that triangular shaped mountain that you see in the center of the screen at the present time with crater Secchi Theta on top of the far northern edge of the mountain.


CC
Roger. We're getting a good view of Mount Marilyn and the Secchi Theta.


LMP
And now we're looking at what we call Boot Hill; occurs 20 seconds into the descent.


LMP
The bright, sharp rimmed crater at the very right edge of the screen, Censorinus T. Now passing the - the 1 minute point in power descent.


CC
Roger. And for your information, your current altitude is 148 nautical miles above the surface.


LMP
Don't you think?


CMP
I'm unable to determine altitude at all looking out the window. I couldn't tell whether we were down at 60 or up at 170.


CC
I bet you could tell if you were down at 50,000 feet.


CMP
I wouldn't be surprised.


LMP
We're passing some steep ridges here. The edge of some old craters that were photographed by Apollo 10; and those - the crew of Apollo 10 was very impressed with the steepness of these ridges when they came over them at about 50,000 feet.







CC
Roger. We can observe they're also steep even from this altitude. You got quite a shadow being cast by the Sun at these low angles.


LMP
The entire surface is getting considerably darker than the surface that we looked at previously when the Sun was quite high above us. The crater in the - bright crater in the center of the screen, - well, the smaller one is Censorinus.


CC
Roger. And we show you low over 1 minute from the terminator at the present time.


LMP
How's the brightness of the picture you're receiving? You think we ought to open f stop some as we approach the terminator?


CC
Yes. The brightness is still doing quite well. You can go ahead and open it up a stop or two. The automatic light level compensation seems to be working beautifully.


LMP
There's a good picture of Boot Hill.


CC
Roger. We're - -


LMP
Three minutes and 15 seconds into the descent.


CC
Roger. We're seeing Boot Hill now.


LMP
The next crater coming into the bottom, that's Duke Island right there, and to the left, the crater - the largest of the craters near the center of the picture right now is Maskelyne W. This is a position check during descent at about 3 minutes and 39 seconds, and it's our down range position check and cross range position check prior to yawing over face up to acquire the landing radar. Past this point, we would be unable to see the surface below us until getting very near the landing area.


CC
Roger. I imagine you'll get a - you'll get a real good look at that tomorrow afternoon.


LMP
Sinuous Rille is the one that was referred to in Apollo 10 as Sidewinder.


CMP
That's a good name, too: Sidewinder and Diamondback. It looks like a couple of snakes down there in a lake bed.







LMP
And we're approaching the terminator now. See the - -


CC
Roger.


LMP
Contrast has increased and only the sunlit side of these ridges remain illuminated, while the dark sides and the shadow will become completely black.


CC
11, this is Houston. The picture's getting a little grainy now. You might go ahead and open up the f stop.


LMP
Landing point is just barely in the darkness. That one crater, the upper part of which you see, lower part completely in darkness. The small, well defined crater is Moltke, which is about abeam of the landing sight.


CC
Roger. We can just see; it looks like a little less than half of its rim right now.


CC
And we can make out just barely some features on the surface, maybe from earthshine.


CC
Are you wide open on the f stop at this time?


CMP
Yes, we are.


LMP
Yes. And it looks like we're just about to get the Sun coming into the lens, so we'll have to move the camera away.


CC
Roger.


CMP
We can't see any earthshine or any surface features at all in earthshine now due to the fact that the LM is very bright and is causing our pupils to contract. It's a very fantastic view to see the terminator as you look along the edge of it. I think you'll agree that some of these craters that you're seeing in the picture now are really accentuated by the lengthening of the shadows as they come close to the terminator.


CC
Yes. It's a very beautiful and a rugged sight that we've got on the screen now.


CMP
And I think you've got some interesting data on thruster firing versus pitch angle. It looks







like that LM just wants to head down towards the surface, is all.


CC
Roger. I have a comment here that says that's what the LM was built for.


CMP
I believe!


CMP
And as the Moon sinks slowly in the west, Apollo 11 bids good day to you.


CC
Roger. We sort of thought it was the Sun setting in the east.


CMP
Well, it depends on your point of view.


CC
Roger. Out.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. When you're ready to copy, I have an LOI 2 PAD and a TEI 5 PAD. Over.


CMP
Okay. Stand by.

Roll all balls, 196 359 00657, plus 00537. DELTA-VT 01592 017 01531. Sextant star 23 1160 138. The rest of the PAD is NA. GDC align, Vega and Deneb 243 183 012. Ullage, two jets 19 seconds. Remarks: On your DAP load, we would like an R1 20101 vice the value which appears in the flight plan. In making the sextant star check this must be done between GET of 79 30 10, at which time the star comes above the horizon, and 79 52 10, which is your local sunrise due to the fact that this star's relatively close to the Sun. Your burn orientation is heads down, retrograde pitched up 28 degress with respect to local horizontal. The calculated values for NOUN 42 are HA 65.6 and HP 54.6. Both of those being plus. Read back. Over.







LMP
Roger, LOI 2: SPS/G&amp;N: 38320, plus 166, minus 081 080 11 3603, minus 01408, minus all balls, minus 00743, all zeros, 196 359 00657, plus 00537, 01592 017 01531 23 1160 138.

HA after the burn - Was that NOUN 42 for HA and 64.6 and HP 54.6? Over.


CC
Roger. On the NOUN 42 value, the last stuff you gave, HA is 65.6, HP is 54.6. Otherwise, I readback correct. I'm standing by with your TEI 5 PAD. Over.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. That's affirmative on the downvoice backup. We'd like you to confirm your UPTELEMETRY switch in the NORMAL position. Over.


CMP
Roger. It's in BLOCK. Did you get us the - You got us a new CSM state vector and an LOI 2 target load in between all that television, didn't you?

CC
Roger. Out.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


LMP
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. During the LOI 1 burn, your erngine burned a little bit more propellant than we predicted, and consequently, we'd like to update - or send you a new TEI 4 PAD. Over.


LMP
Okay.


CMP
Our chamber pressure onboard was higher that time, too. It's all on the onboard tape, the time entry, and the chamber pressure; but to make a long story short, it worked its way up to 100.


CC
Roger.


CC
And down here, we showed a chamber pressure of on the order of 103 to 104 psi during your burn on playback.


CMP
Okay.


LMP
Go ahead with the TEI 4.


CC
Roger. TEI 4 revised: SPS/G&amp;N: 38320, minus 055, plus 060 084 30 2749, plus 31380, plus 03475, minus 01032; roll NA, pitch 034. Rest of the PAD is NA. Ullage two jets 16 seconds, undocked. No LOI 2. Over.

CC
11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston.


LMP
Roger. Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. We've been looking at your systems data on playback, and everything is looking good. In particular, the SPS looks good. I would like to







remind you, though, of a request to perform this burn on the bank A ball valves only, and you are GO for LOI 2. Also, we have currently in the flight plan, you scheduled tomorrow to start entering the LM at about 96 hours GET, and we'd like to know if you have any plans to initiate this ingress into the LM earlier. If so, we can call the people in ahead of time. Over.


LMP
Well, we didn't have any plans to. No. We just wanted to be ready at that time.


CC
Roger. We just wanted to make sure that we were ready when you were ready. Over.


LMP
Okay. And to get the sextant star in LOI 2, that's roll zero. Is that affirmative?


CC
That's affirmative. Roll zero.


LMP
Okay.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Five minutes until LOS. And with respect to your request for the nitrogen bottle pressures preburn, just before the burn, we were showing 2270 pounds per square inch on bottle Alfa and 2350 on bottle Bravo. Over.

CDR
It isn't true everywhere, but there's certainly places where there seems to be a slope downward towards the shoreline on the mare. In other words, from the mare down to the shoreline is a downward slope indicating that it might be a lava flow.

All that procedure for P22 seemed to work very well. The only thing that was a little odd, is that there was some DAP thruster activity. I had pitch in ACCEL COMMAND, and roll and yaw in RATE COMMAND, and somehow, roll and yaw got excited and the DAP went into a flurry of thruster firing. We've noticed the same thing in the CMS, and just written it off as a CMS peculiarity.

CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
11, Houston. Roger. Reading you fine, and it looks like the automatic REACQ went very well just as soon as you came around the limb. We have several small items to discuss with you here just before you go to sleep. Over.


CMP
Go ahead. Over.


CC
Okay, 11. First of all, on our LM systems checks, everything went fine. I would like to remind you, though, tomorrow you may see an ascent pressure light when you activate the MC&amp;W. There should be no problem, however. You did note that the APS AUX tank pressure was only reading 111 psi, which is normal at this point, but below the level which will trigger your light due to the helium which has been dissolved into the propellant. Over.


CMP
Roger. Understand that. Thank you.


CC
Roger. And next item, the supercritical helium rise rate is nominal, and you also had that question for us about your thruster activity during the P22 on the last REV. Believe we understand that now, as you reported that your pitch was in ACCEL COMMAND and your yaw and roll were in RATE COMMAND. You were firing your pitch thrusters. This will couple rates into your yaw and roll axes, and the - You were at that time holding only half a degree deadband and coupling rates into yaw and roll produced the extra firings about the yaw and roll axes. Over.


CMP
Yes. That may be true. It's very peculiar coupling, in that it waits longer than you would think and its reaction is greater than you would think. We were getting yaw rates of around four tenths of a degree per second, for example.


CC
Roger, Mike. We did play the data back, and that's the way it looked upon analysis of the chart recordings back here. Over.


CMP
Okay. Fine.







CC
They've also looked at the results of your landmark tracking. The marks all apparently were very good, and we've got a full page of data here relative to the altitudes of the various site locations, which I won't read up to you, but I did want to let you know that the marks apparently went very well. I also have your consumable budgets, particularly your RCS propellant quantities. They're Deltas from nominal if you should want them. Your worst quad is quad Charlie, which is 9 percent low. I'll not read up the others unless you want them. Over.


CMP
Okay. How about the O2 fuel cell purge? You want that now?


CC
I'll have to stand by just a moment.


LMP
Okay. And then the other one is, we're still charging battery A.


CC
11, Houston. We would like to delay the fuel cell purge until the backside of the Moon, and you go ahead and - should terminate your battery charge at this time. Over.


LMP
Okay. Understand. I knew we had another O2 and H2 purge coming up in the morning; I wasn't sure whether you wanted to go through with this one or not. I'll wait until the next side and then do it.


CC
That's fine, Buzz.


LMP
Terminate battery charging now.


CC
That's right, and one other systems item here - in order to balance your CRYO tanks, would you get your O2 tank 1 and your H 2 tank 2 heaters off? Over.


CMP
Okay. I have O2 tank heater 1 off, and H2 tank heater 2 off.


CC
That's right, Mike, and we believe you have your quad Bravo and quad Charlie turned off in your DAP at this time, and a 5 degree deadband. We'd prefer a 10 degree deadband for your sleep period overnight here. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CC
One other item relative to a malfunction procedure. It's unlikely that you'll have to worry about this







tomorrow, but in your malfunction list under docking on page F11 9, there is a malfunction procedure for a high O2 flow rate at the top of - under tunnel at the top of page 11 9. We would like to have you not use that malfunction procedure should you encounter the high O2 flow rate, and instead, check back with Houston for a revised procedure should you find that situation. Over.


CMP
Understand, and note has been made in my checklist.


CC
11, Houston. Roger. That just about takes care of all the items we have here on the ground before time to hit the sack, and I guess you will have a presleep check for us before you go to bed.


LMP

Roger, Buzz. It sounds like a good idea for some of your surveying work there inside the cockpit. Over.


LMP
Okay. You want to run that by with whoever might be concerned?


CC
I sure will.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We have apparently lost the high gain lock. We would appreciate it if you would give us a help manually to try to relock up on the high gain. Over.

Apollo 11, Houston. We're still unable to pick you up on the high gain antenna. Request you go to MANUAL, and wide beamwidth. The pitch and yaw angles in your checklist are good ones. You should be able to find us there. Over.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read now?

Loud and clear. You faded out on your last transmission. Over.

Roger. That's all we want. We want to stay in narrow, and we're a little puzzled about why we lost you here a few minutes ago. Do you have any ideas?


LMP
No, we sure don't (cough) - sure don't. We're showing - we're showing about 15 degrees plus pitch and about 270. That ought to be good and clear.


CC
We concur there. We still don't have any good ideas on why we were lost then.


CC
11, Houston. Would you confirm that we did acquire automatically when you came around the limb for this passage. Over.


LMP
That's confirmed.


CC
Thank you.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
11, Houston. On your AUTO RCS SELECT switches, we show quad Bravo disabled but quad Charlie only partially disabled. Charlie 3, I believe, is the only one you have selected off. Is that correct?


CMP
Yes. Roger. That's correct.







CC
Roger.

How do they look to you now, Houston?


CC
11, Houston. We see them all disabled at this time. Thank you.


CMP
Thank you.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.


LMP
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
11, Houston. We're going to try to check out this ability to automatically reacquire on the S band, and what we want to do is to secure our uplink carrier for about 30 seconds. Then we will turn it back on and see if the spacecraft equipment will automatically reacquire. So if you do not get a call from us within about 3 minutes, that means we have not been able to reacquire and request your assistance on a manual acquisition. Over.


LMP
Okay. We understand.


CC
11, Houston. We also would appreciate - if you will note the angles that the antenna tracks through in its attempt to reacquire. Over.


LMP
Roger. We'll do that.


CC
11, Houston. It looks like we're locked back up again with no delay. How does it look on board? Over.


LMP
Roger. The signal strength dropped very rapidly to zero; and the pitch and yaw, in about 3 secconds, moved toward 40 degrees pitch and 240 degrees yaw. Right now, they're sitting on about 15 degrees pitch and about 265 degrees yaw. So they didn't move very far, about 30 degrees apiece; and then they picked right back on up again. Over.


CC
Roger. Some of "The Luckiest People" in the background there. We copied your pitch and yaw angles.


CC
11, Houston. Could you give us the location of your - pitch and yaw location of your position indicators? Over.







LMP
Roger. They're in the same position as the antenna right now; plus 15 degrees pitch and - no, now wait a minute. I got them - got it at about 275 instead of 265.


CC
Okay. Thank you.


CC
11, Houston. We'd like to try the same procedure once more. We'll leave the carrier a little longer and be back up for a call within 4 minutes. Over.


LMP
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. We're locked back up again. Can you give us a report on how the antenna behaved?


LMP
Roger. It was essentially identical as before. The pitch went to 45, 40 to 45 and the yaw went to about - to about 255, 245 to 255; and then it rather quickly locked up at 15 degrees pitch and 270 yaw. Over.


CC
11, Houston. Roger. Your angles are 45 and 255. Do I understand that as soon as the carrier dropped, it went to these angles; or did it only go to these angles after the uplink carrier was reenabled and the antenna began to reacquire? Over.


LMP
No. As soon as the carrier dropped off, why, it drifted over into those angles and stayed there. Then when it came back up again, why, it hunted around for a while, but it didn't get any further off. Gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now; and then the signal strength would take several jumps as evidently it goes from wide to medium to narrow. Over.


CC
11, Houston. Understand. And on another subject, request you zero your optics for the night. Over.


LMP
Roger. Zeroed.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Can you confirm that you have changed the CO2 filter as per flight plan in the last hour? Over?


CMP
No. We're still eating. We're about to do it. We'll let you know.







CC
Roger, 11. And we've got about 14 minutes until LOS. A0S is 86 30, an hour away. We're wondering whether or not you plan to have one man up at that time or would you all like to be asleep inside the next hour? Over.


CMP
Somebody will be up.


CC
Roger. The thing that we're still puzzling on is the antenna, and if - as long as there will be somebody up, why, we would like to have somebody check the automatic REACQ on the next AOS.


CMP
Okay. We'll do that. We haven't chlorinated the water yet, and we haven't changed the lithium hydroxide. We're just still finishing up dinner.


CC
Roger, Mike. Thank you.

CC
Roger. Among the large headlines concerning Apollo this morning, there's one asking that you watch for a lovely girl with a big rabbit. An ancient legend says a beautiful Chinese girl called Chang-o has been living there for 4000 years. It seems she was banished to the Moon because she stole the pill of immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large Chinese rabbit, who is easy to spot since he is always standing on his hind feet in the shade of a cinnamon tree. The name of the rabbit is not reported.


LMP
Okay. We'll keep a close eye out for the bunny girl.


CC
Roger. You residents of the spacecraft Columbia may be interested in knowing that today is Independence Day in the country of Colombia. Gloria Diaz of the Philippines was crowned Miss Universe last night. She defeated 60 other girls for the global beauty title. Miss Diaz is 18, with black hair and eyes, and measures 34-1/2, 23, 34-1/2. First runner up was Miss Australia, followed by Miss Israel, and Miss Japan. While you're on your way back Tuesday night, the American and







National League Allstars will be playing ball in Washington. Mel Stottlemyre of the Yankees is expected to be the American League's first pitcher. No one is predicting who will be first pitcher for the National League yet. They have nine on the roster. Even though research has certainly paid off in the space program, research doesn't always pay off, it seems. The Woodstream Corporation, parent company of the Animal Trap Company of America which has made more than a billion wooden spring mousetraps, reports that it built a better mousetrap but the world didn't beat a door to its path - didn't beat a path to its door. As a matter of fact, the company had to go back to the oldfashioned kind. They said, "We should have spent more time researching housewives and less time researching mice".

so we've got an RCS TTA light and we've got four out of the eight other bright colored red flags. I think that this is explained by the fact that we are in PGNS and AUTO and unable to fire the thrusters.

Roger, sir.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We recommend you exit P12. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Hey, Houston, that may have seemed like a very long final phase. The AUTO targeting was taking us right into a football field size - football field sized crater, with a large number of big boulders and rocks for about ... one or two crater diameters around it, and it required a ... in P66 and flying manually over the rock field to find a reasonably good area.


CC
Roger. We copy. It was beautiful from here, Tranquility. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
We'll get to the details of what's around here, but it looks like a collection of just about every variety of shape, angularity, granularity, about every variety of rock you could find. The colors - Well, it varies pretty much depending on how you're looking relative to the zerophase point. There doesn't appear to be too much of a general color at all. However, it looks as though some of the rocks and boulders, of which there are quite a few in the near area, it looks as though they're going to have some interesting colors to them. Over.


CC
Roger. Copy. Sounds good to us, Tranquility. We'll let you press on through the simulated countdown, and we'll talk to you later. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger.







LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. This one sixth g is just like the airplane.


CC
Roger. Tranquility. Be advised there's lots of smiling faces in this room and all over the world. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Well, there are two of them up here.


CC

CMP (COLUMBIA)
And don't forget one in the command module.


CC
Roger.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. We have you pitched up about 4 1/2 degrees. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
That's confirmed by our local observation.


CC
Roger.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
And thanks for putting me on relay, Houston. I was missing all the action.


CC
Roger. We'll enable MSFN relay.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
I just got it, I think.


CC
Roger, Columbia. This is Houston. Say something. They ought to be able to hear you. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger, Tranquility Base. It sure sounded great from up here. You guys did a fantastic job.

Tranquility Base, Houston. All your consumables are solid. You're looking good in every respect. We copy the DPS are venting. Everything is copasetic. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Thank you, Houston.


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, the guys that said that we wouldn't be able to tell precisely where we are are the winners today. We were a little busy worrying about program alarms and things like that in the part of the descent where we would normally be picking out our landing spot; and aside from a good look at several of the craters we came over in the final descent, I haven't been able to pick out the things on the horizon as a reference as yet.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. No sweat. We'll figure out - We'll figure it out. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
You might be interested to know that I don't think we notice any difficulty at all in adapting to one sixth g. It seems immediately natural to move in this environment.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. We copy. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
The area out the left hand window is a relatively level plain cratered with a fairly large number of craters of the 5  to 50 foot variety, and some ridges - small, 20, 30 feet high, I would guess, and literally thousands of little 1  and 2 foot craters around the area. We see some angular blocks out several hundred feet in front of us that are probably 2 feet in size and have angular edges. There is a hill in view, just about on the ground track ahead of us. Difficult to estimate, but might be a half a mile or a mile.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. We copy Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Sounds like it looks a lot better than it did yesterday - -


CDR (TRANQ)
...







CMP (COLUMBIA)
- - at that very low Sun angle. It looked rough as a cob then.


CDR (TRANQ)
It really was rough, Mike. Over the targeted landing area, it was extremely rough, cratered, and large numbers of rocks that were probably some, many larger than 5 or 10 feet in size.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
When in doubt, land long.


CDR (TRANQ)
So we did.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. After you get through this P57, we'd like an E memory dump. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. After this first P57, you want an E memory dump.


CC
That's affirmative.


CC
Columbia, Houston. We have a P22 update for you, if you're ready to copy. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
At your service, sir.


CC
Roger, Mike. T1, 104 32 18; T2, 104 37 28. And that is 4 miles south. This is based on a targeted landing site. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Roger. Understand based on a targeted landing site; T1, 104 32 18; T2, 104 37 28, and 4 miles south.


CC
Roger.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Do you have any idea whether they landed left or right of center line? Just a little bit long, is that all we know?


CC
Apparently that's about all we can tell. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Thank you.


CC
Tranquility, Houston - -


CDR (TRANQ)
And, Houston, our mission timer is now reading 902 34 47 and static.







CC
Roger. Copy your mission timer's now static. It - Say again the time?


CDR (TRANQ)
902 34 47.


CC
Roger. Copy, Tranquility. That gravity align looked good to us. We see you recycling.


LMP (TRANQ)
Well, no. I was trying to get time, 16 65 out, and somehow it proceeded on to the 622 before I could do a VERB 32 ENTER. I want to log a time here, and then I'd like to know whether you want me to proceed on the torquing angles or to go back and reenter again before torquing. Over.


CC
Roger, Buzz. Stand by.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. We'd like you to recall P57 and run through the gravity align one more time. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. I concur with that.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. For the mission timer, two suggestions. Set the circuit breaker, panel 11; also reset and attempt to start. That nine in the first digit might have something to do with it. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. We've tried both of those. If the circuit breaker is in when I reset the - put it in RESET, I get 902 04 40. When I release it now, I get 902 04 49. I'm going to cycle the circuit breaker.


CC
Roger.


CDR (TRANQ)
I cycled the circuit breaker and got all nines. And we'll not now reset from all nines.


CC
Roger.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. We'll research this problem and be back with you momentarily on the mission event time - correction, the mission timer.







CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


CDR (TRANQ)
I'd say the color of the - The local surface is very comparable to that we observed from orbit at this Sun angle, about 10 degrees Sun angle, or that nature. It's pretty much without color. It's gray, and it's a very white, chalky gray, as you look into the zero phase line; and it's considerably darker gray, more like a ash - ashen gray as you look out 90 degrees to the Sun. The - Some of the surface rocks in close here that have been fractured or disturbed by the rocket engine plume are coated with this light gray on the outside; but where they've been broken, they display a dark - very dark gray interior; and it looks like it could be country basalt.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. We see the NOUN 93, VERB 34.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. I assume you wanted it. Roger.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Please vent fuel and OX again. Over. It's building back up.

Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. Was your eight o'clock Houston time a reference to opening the hatch or starting the PREP for EVA at that time? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
That would be hatch opening.







CC
That's what we thought. Thank you much.

CMP (COLUMBIA)
Well, the area looks smooth, but I was unable to see him. I just picked out a distinguishable crater nearby and marked on it.


CC
Roger.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
It looks like a nice area, though.


CC
Hello, Columbia. Houston. I understand you could not see Tranquility. What were you marking on? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. I say again, I could not see him. AUTO optics pointed at a spot very close to the coordinates which you gave me, so I picked a tiny crater in that area and marked on it so I will be able to have repeatable data, but I was unable to see him.


CC

CMP (COLUMBIA)
Ready to copy.


CC
Columbia, Houston. First of all, we'd like a waste water dump to 10 percent on the backside. Secondly, it does not look like we are going to need any plane change at this time, so we will not be uplinking a new REFSMMAT. Third item, I would like all of your CRYO heaters to AUTO, and we are ready for a battery charge, battery BRAVO; it will last about 7 hours. If you should go to sleep, we will be terminating that BATT charge, but at the moment, we can go ahead and start the BATT charge on BATT Bravo. And a final item, for your SM RCS configuration for your rest period, register 1 for the DAP is 11111; DAP register 2, 01100. And your AUTO RCS select







switches, quad Alfa, pitch jets on only, quad Bravo all on, quad Charlie and quad Delta all off. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Dump waste water to 10 percent on the backside. Use prior REFSMMAT, CRYO heaters on to AUTO, battery B charge until I go to sleep. DAP is 11111, 01100. Select quads A pitch only on, C and D all up. Over.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Roger.


CC
Columbia, Houston. We will have a state vector update for you a little later. We are not prepared with it right now; and on another subject, from Tranquility Base, they are prepared to begin their EVA early. They expect to begin DEPRESS operations in about 3 hours at 108, approximately 108 GET. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Sounds good to me. Tell them to eat some lunch before they go.

CMP (COLUMBIA)
You're loud and clear. The waste water dump is down to 10 percent. I have a question on the P22. Do you want me to do another P22, or is all that information just for my own use in tracking the LM for photographic purposes?


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. We request that you perform another P22. We'd like you to let the AUTO optics take care of the tracking and devote your energies to trying to pick out the LM on the lunar surface. If you can find the LM, of course. We're looking for marks on it; but tracking of geographical features doesn't do us all that much good. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Fine. I'll do it. And on the ECS system, the - Whatever the problem was, it seems to have gone away without any changing of J52 sensors or anything like that. My glycol evaporator outlet TEMP is up above 50 now, and it's quite comfortable in the cockpit; so we'll talk more about that one later.

Stand by.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. The best we can do on topo features is to advise you to look to the west of the irregularly shaped crater, and then work on down to the southwest of it. Over.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Another possibility is the southern rim of the southern of the two oldlooking craters. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger, Houston. Columbia ... I kept my eyes glued to the sextant that time hoping I'd get a flash of reflected light off the LM, but I wasn't able to see any of my scan areas that you suggested.


CC
Roger. On that southern of the old craters, there's a small bright crater on the southern rim. One plot would put him slightly to the west of that small bright crater, about 500 to 1000 feet. Do you see anything down there? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Its going past now, Bruce, but I scanned that area that you are talking about very closely, and no, I did not see anything.


CC

Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. On your LAM 2 map, we'd like to confirm the topographical area in which you were looking on this last period of sightings. As we understand you, you were looking in the vicinity of Papa 7 to November 8. Is that correct? Over.

Roger. We found that one.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
The other one is located at 7 - The other one is located at 7.2, two thirds of the way from Mike to Nan.


CC
Roger. We believe you were looking a little too far to the west and south. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Understand. I was looking where auto optics was tracking, on the average, and understand that it should have been more to the north and more to the west; actually a tiny bit outside the circle, huh?


CC
More to the north and a little more to the east. The feature that I was describing to you, the small bright crater on the rim of the large, fairly old crater, would be about Mike 0.8 and 8.2. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Well, just give me your best estimate as to his location and his coordinate system, and I'll plot it on my map and go from there.

0MNI Delta and you were cut out. I never got your coordinates on estimated LM position. Over.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Estimated LM position is latitude plus 0.799, longitude over 2 plus 11.730. On your chart we would place it - Stand by on the charts and readback on the latitude and longitude.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes. The latitude and longitude over 2, 799 and 11730 are the ones that I been using in P22. But what I'm interested in is - is grid coordinates on that map we're using.


CC

CMP (COLUMBIA)
Thank you.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. Could you enable the S band relay at least one way from Eagle to Columbia so I can hear what's going on?


CC

CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Are you aware that Eagle plans the EVA about 4 hours early? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Affirmative. When's hatch open time in GET estinated?

CC
Roger.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead.


CC
On your next pass, Columbia, rather than performing a P22 as such, we would like you to look in the vicinity of the coordinates that we gave you, which is our best analysis based on map physics and the trajectory, and we also have another set of coordinates that we would like you to search in the vicinity of. This last one being based on all interpretation of the geological features that were seen by the crew on their way down. The coordinates of this second site are Mike 0.7 and 8.0. I say again, Mike 0.7 and 8.0. I say again, Mike 0.7 and 8.0. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Copy. Mike 0.7 and 8.0. The only thing is, my best tool for looking is the sextant and if I'm going to crank the sextant up, I might as well let P22 go at the same time, or don't you think so?


CC
Roger. If you want to go that way, crank it up and then you can drive it around and look where you want. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay.


CC
And if you can find the LM, then by all means, track it or make a note of where it was and we







can track it on the next REV. If you are ready, we have a REFSMMAT update that we can pass up to you at this time, if you will give us P00 in ACCEPT. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. P00 in ACCEPT you got. And this is an updated landing site RESFMMAT. We still believe that a plane change is not required. Is that affirmative?


CC
That's affirmative, Columbia.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Good show.

Roger. We're getting a picture on the TV.


LMP (TRANQ)
You got a good picture, huh?


CC
There's a great deal of contrast in it, and currently it's upside down on our monitor, but we can make out a fair amount of detail.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Will you verify the position - the opening I ought to have on the camera?


CC
Stand by.


CC
Okay. Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. I just checked getting back up to that first step, Buzz. It's - not even collapsed too far, but it's adequate to get back up.







CC
Roger. We copy.


CDR (TRANQ)
It takes a pretty good little jump.


Oh 13 23 25        CC
Buzz, this is Houston. F/2 - 1/160th second for shadow photography on the sequence camera.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay.


CDR (TRANQ)
I'm at the foot of the ladder. The LM footpads are only depressed in the surface about 1 or 2 inches, although the surface appears to be very, very fine grained, as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. Down there, it's very fine.


CDR (TRANQ)
I'm going to step off the LM now.


CDR (TRANQ)
THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR (A) MAN, ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND.


CDR (TRANQ)
And the - the surface is fine and powdery. I can - I can pick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers like powdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. We're copying.


CDR (EVA)
There seems to be no difficulty in moving around as we suspected. It's even perhaps easier than the simulations at one sixth g that we performed in the various simulations on the ground. It's actually no trouble to walk around. Okay. The descent engine did not leave a crater of any size. It has about 1 foot clearance on the ground. We're essentially on a very level place here. I can see some evidence of rays emanating from the descent engine, but a very insignificant amount.


CDR (EVA)
Okay, Buzz, we ready to bring down the camera?


LMP (EVA)
I'm all ready. I think it's been all squared away and in good shape.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.







LMP (EVA)
Okay. You'll have to pay out all the LEC. It looks like it's coming out nice and evenly.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. It's quite dark here in the shadow and a little hard for me to see that I have good footing. I'll work my way over into the sunlight here without looking directly into the Sun.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. It's taut now.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I think you're pulling the wrong one.


CDR (EVA)
I'm just - Okay. I'm ready to pull it down now. There was still a little bit left in the -


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Don't hold it quite so tight.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.

Looking up at the LM, I'm standing directly in tne shadow now looking up at Buzz in the window. And I can see everything quite clearly. The light is sufficiently bright backlighted into the front of the LM, that everything is very clearly visible,

Roger. I'm going to get to that just as soon as I finish these picture series.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Going to get the contingency sample there, Neil.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







CDR (EVA)
Right.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. That's good.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. The contingency sample is down and it's ***. Looks like it's a little difficult to dig through the initial crust.


CDR (EVA)
This is very interesting. It's a very soft surface, but here and there where I plug with the contingency sample collector, I run into a very hard surface, but it appears to be very cohesive material of the same sort. I'll try to get a rock in here. Just a couple.


LMP (EVA)
That looks beautiful from here, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
It has a stark beauty all its own. It's like much of the high desert of the United States. It's different but it's very pretty out here. Be advised that a lot of the rock samples out here, the hard rock samples, have what appear to be vesicles in the surface. Also, I am looking at one now that appears to have some sort of phenocryst.

Okay. The handle is off the *** in about 6 or 8 inches into the surface. I could *** easy ***.


CDR (EVA)
Yes, it is. it's - I'm sure I could push it in farther, but it's hard for me to bend down further than that.

Now, you can throw so far.

You can really throw things a long way up here.


CDR (EVA)
That pocket open, Buzz?


LMP (EVA)
Yes, it is. It's not up against your suit though. Hit it back once more. More toward the inside. Okay. That's good.

Neil, yes we are getting a TV picture.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. We're getting a picture. You're not in it at the present time. We can see the bag on the LEC being moved by Buzz, though. Here you come into our field of view.


CDR (EVA)
...


LMP (EVA)
Roger.


CDR (EVA)
Hold it a second. First let me move that over the edge for you.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Are you ready for me to come out?


CDR (EVA)
Yes. Just stand by a second. I'll move this over the handrail.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
All right. That's got it. Are you ready?


CDR (EVA)
All set. Okay. You saw what difficulties I was having. I'll try to watch your PLSS from underneath here.

LMP (EVA)
All right. The backup camera's positioned.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. Your PLSS is - Looks like it is clearing okay. Your toes are about to come over the sill. Okay. Now drop your PLSS down. There you go; you're clear. And laterally you're good. You've got an inch clearance on top of your PLSS.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. You need a little bit of arching of the back to come down. ... How are are my feet from the edge?


CDR (EVA)
Okay. You're right at the edge of the porch.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Back in *** little of foot movement *** porch. Little arching of the back. Helmet comes up and clears the bulkhead without any trouble at all.


CDR (EVA)
Looks good.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Based on your camera transfer with the LEC, do you foresee any difficulties in SRC transfer? Over.


CDR (EVA)
Negative.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Now I want to back up and partially close the hatch.


LMP (EVA)
Making sure not to lock it on my way Â¢ut.


CDR (EVA)
(Laughter) A pretty good thought.


LMP (EVA)
That's our home for the next couple of hours and we want to take good care of it. Okay. I'm on the top step and I can look down over the RCU, landing gear pads. It's a very simple matter to hop down from one step to the next.


CDR (EVA)
Yes. I found I could be very comfortable, and walking is also very comfortable.


CDR (EVA)
You've got three more steps and then a long one.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







LMP (EVA)
Okay. I'm going to leave that one foot up there and both hands down to about the fourth rung up.


CDR (EVA)
There you go.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Now I think I'll do the same ***


CDR (EVA)
A little more. About another inch.


CDR (EVA)
THERE YOU GOT IT.


CDR (EVA)
That's a good step. About a 3-footer.


LMP (EVA)
Beautiful view!


CDR (EVA)
Isn't that something! Magnificent sight out here.


LMP (EVA)
Magnificent desolation.


LMP (EVA)
Looks like the secondary strut *** little thermal effects on it right here, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Yes. I noticed that. That seems to be the worst, although similar effects are on - all around.


BEGIN LUNAR REV 18


MS
... powder, isn't it?


CDR (EVA)
Isn't it fine?


LMP (EVA)
Right in this area I don't think there's much of any *** fine powder *** clods together, and it's hard to tell whether it's a clod or a rock.


CDR (EVA)
Notice how you can kick it out.


LMP (EVA)
Yes. And it bounces and then -


LMP (EVA)
Reaching down is fairly easy. I got my suit dirty at this stage.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words &amp;nd phrases.







LMP (EVA)
The mass of the backpack does have some effect in inertia.


LMP (EVA)
There's a slight tendency, I can see now, to *** backwards *** due to the soft, very soft texture.


CDR (EVA)
You're standing on a rock, a big rock there now.


LMP (EVA)
This pad sure didn't ***


CDR (EVA)
No. It didn't.


LMP (EVA)
There's absolutely no crater there at all from the engine.


CDR (EVA)
No.


LMP (EVA)
I wonder if about right under the engine is where the probe might have hit.


CDR (EVA)
I'd like that.


CDR (EVA)
Yes. I think that's a good representation of our sideward velocity at touchdown there - hole at the probe.


LMP (EVA)
I see that probe over on the minus-Y strut. It's broken off and bent back up.


CDR (EVA)
It did, didn't it? The other two both bent over.


LMP (EVA)
Can't say too much for the visibility right here without the visor up. It's dark. It looks like there is a *** surface of it is *** pounded rock *** And incidentally, these rocks *** very powdery surface ***


CC
Say again, please, Buzz; you're cutting out.


LMP (EVA)
I say that the rocks are rather slippery.


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
A powdery surface when the sun hits. *** they split up all the very little fine porouses *** Will tend to slide over it rather easily.


LMP (EVA)
Traction *** seems quite good. ***

LMP (EVA)
*** About to lose my balance in one direction and recovery is a quite natural and very easy *** And, moving your arms around, Jack, doesn't *** off the surface *** not quite that light-footed.


CDR (EVA)
And, I have the insulation off the MESA now and MESA seems to be in good shape.


LMP (EVA)
Got to be careful that you are leaning in the direction you want to go, otherwise you *** slightly inebriated. In other words, you have to cross your foot over to stay underneath where your center-of-mass is.


LMP (EVA)
And, Neil, didn't I say we might see some purple rocks?


CDR (EVA)
Find a purple rock?


LMP (EVA)
Yes. They are small, sparkly *** fragments *** places *** would make a first guess that some sort of biotite *** We'll leave that to further analysis ***


LMP (EVA)
*** compact underneath *** completely no *** you don't sink down more than ... a quarter of an inch.


CDR (EVA)
Okay, Houston. I'm going to change lenses on you.


CC
Roger, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Okay, Houston. Tell me if you're getting a new picture.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. That's affirmative. We're getting a new picture. You can tell it's a longer focal length lens. And for your information, all LM systems are GO. Over.


LMP (EVA)
We appreciate that. Thank you.


LMP (EVA)
Neil is now unveiling the plaque *** gear.


CC
Roger. We got you boresighted, but back under one track.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







CDR (EVA)
For those who haven't read the plaque, we'll read the plaque that's on the front landing gear of this LM. First there's two hemispheres, one showing each of the two hemispheres of the Earth. Underneath it says "Here Man from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind." It has the crew members' signatures and the signature of the President of the United States.


CDR (EVA)
Ready for the camera?


LMP (EVA)
No. I'll get it. No, you take this TV on out.


CDR (EVA)
Watch the LEC, there.


LMP (EVA)
Now I'm afreid these ... materials are going to get dusty ***


LMP (EVA)
The surface material is powdery. *** How good your lens is, but if you can *** smudges ... very much like a very finely powdered carbon, but it's very pretty looking.


CDR (EVA)
Would you pull out some of my cable for me, Buzz?


LMP (EVA)
Houston. How close are you able to get things in focus ?


CC
This is Houston. We can see Buzz's right hand. It is somewhat out of focus. I'd say we were focusing down to probably - oh, about 8 inches to a foot behind the position of his hand when he was pulling out the cable.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. How's the temperature on there?


CDR (EVA)
Temperature of the camera is showing zero.


LMP (EVA)
I'm a little cool. I think I'll trade ***


LMP (EVA)
I'm on intermediate now, Houston, and I show 3.78. No flags, 70 ***


CC
Houston. Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
And, we'll probably need a little *** distance *** back location *** television camera.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







LMP (EVA)
Neil, look at the minus Y-strut, the direction of travel there *** travel from right to left.


CDR (EVA)
Right.


LMP (EVA)
This one over here underneath the ascent engine where the probe first hit - the minus-Y probe first hit.


CDR (EVA)
I got plenty of cable?


LMP (EVA)
You've got plenty. Plenty more.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I think I've got the end of it.


CDR (EVA)
Something interesting: in the bottom of this little crater here - It may be -


LMP (EVA)
Now keep going. We've got a lot more.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Getting a little harder to pull out, here.


CDR (EVA)
How far would you say I am, Buzz?


LMP (EVA)
Forty, 50 feet. Why don't you turn around and let them get a view from there and see what the field of view looks like?


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
You're backing into the cable.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Turn around to your right, would be better.


CDR (EVA)
I don't want to go into the Sun if I can avoid it.


LMP (EVA)
That's right. Yes.


CDR (EVA)
I'll just leave it - -


LMP (EVA)
- - All right.


CDR (EVA)
- - sit like that and walk around it.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







LMP (EVA)
Houston. How's that field of view going to pick up the MESA? *** far away?


CC
Roger.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. The field of view is okay. We'd like you to aim it a little bit more to the right. Over.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. That's all the cable we have. *** not going out. I'll start working on the solar wind - -


CC
A little bit too much to the right. Can you bring it back left about 4 or 5 Degrees?


CC
Okay. That looks good Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Okay, now. Do you think I ought to be farther away, or closer?


LMP (EVA)
Can't get too much further away.


CDR (EVA)
Let's try it like that for a while. I'll get a couple of panoramas with it, here.


CC
Roger. You look okay as far as distance goes, Neil. And we'll line you up again when you finish the panorama. Now you're going too fast on the panorama sweep. You're going to have to stop, or -


CDR (EVA)
I haven't stopped - I haven't set it down yet. That's the first picture in the panorama. Right there.


CC
Roger.


CDR (EVA)
It's taken just a little - about north, north east.


CDR (EVA)
Tell me if you've got a picture, Houston.


CC
We've got a beautiful picture, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. I'm going to move it.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







CC
Okay. Here's another good one.


CC
Okay, we got that one.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. Now, this one is right down front, straight west. And I want to know if you can see an angular rock in the foreground.


CC
Roger. We have a large angular rock in the foreground, and it looks like a much smaller rock a couple of inches to the left of it. Over.


CDR (EVA)
All right. And then on beyond it about 10 feet is an even larger rock that's very rounded. That rock is about - The closest one to you is about sticking out of the sand about 1 foot. And it's about a foot and one half long, and it's about 6 inches thick, but it's standing on edge.


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
Okay, Neil. I've got the table out and the bag deployed.


CC
We've got this view, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
This is straight south.


CC
Roger. And we see the shadow of the LM.


CDR (EVA)
Roger. The little hill just beyond the shadow of the LM is a pair of elongate craters about - probably the pair together is about 40 feet long and 20 feet across, and they're probably 6 feet deep. We'll probably get some more work in there later.


CC
Roger. We see Buzz going about his work.


CDR (EVA)
How's that for a final?


CC
For a final orientation, we'd like it to come left about 5 degrees. Over.


CC
Now back to the right about half as much.


CDR
Okay?


CC
Okay. That looks good there, Neil.







CDR (EVA)
Okay.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. You can make a Mark, Houston. *** deployed.


CC
Roger. Solar wind.


LMP (EVA)
And, incidently, you can use the shadow that the staff makes to *** getting it perpendicular ***


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
Some of these small depressions *** tend to sink - oh, maybe 2 or 3 inches. *** suggest exactly what the Surveyor pictures showed when they pushed away a little bit. You get a force transmitted through the upper surface of the soil and about 5 or 6 inches of bay breaks loose and moves as if it were caked on the surface, when in fact it really isn't.


CDR (EVA)
I noticed in the soft spots where we had footprints nearly an inch deep that the soil is very cohesive and it will retain a - will retain a slope of probably 70 degrees along side of the footprints.


CDR (EVA)
Okay?


LMP (EVA)
Yes. I think that's excellent.


LMP (EVA)
They didn't come off?


LMP (EVA)
*** get the ***


CDR (EVA)
*** that part? *** a rock here.


LMP (EVA)
You'll have to extend that one.


CC

CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia on the high gain. Over.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes. Reading you loud and clear. How's it going?


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words or phrases.







CC
Roger. The EVA is progressing beautifully. I believe they are setting up the flag now.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Great.


CC
I guess you're about the only person around that doesn't have TV coverage of the scene.


04 14 09 25 CMP (COLUMBIA)
That's all right. I don't mind a bit.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
How is the quality of the TV?


CC
Oh, it's beautiful, Mike. It really is.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Oh, gee, that's great! Is the lighting half way decent?


CC
Yes, indeed. They've got the flag up now and you can see the stars and stripes on the lunar surface.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Beautiful. Just beautiful.


LMP (EVA)
That's good. See if you can pull that end off a little bit. Take that end up a little.


CDR (EVA)
It won't pull out.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.


CDR (EVA)
Roger, Houston. Loud and clear.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
Loud and clear, Houston.


CC
Roger, Buzz.


LMP (EVA)
I'd like to evaluate the various paces that a person can *** traveling on the lunar surface. I believe I'm out of your field of view. Is that right, now, Houston?


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







CC
That's affirmative, Buzz.


CC
You are in our field of view now.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. You do have to be rather careful to keep track of where your center of mass is. Sometimes, it takes about two or three paces to make sure you've got your feet underneath you.


LMP (EVA)
About two to three or maybe four easy paces can bring you to a nearly smooth stop. *** change directions, like a football player, you just have to to *** foot out to the side and cut a little bit.


LMP (EVA)
So called kangeroo hop does work, but it seems that your forward mobility is not quite as good as - it is in the conventional - more conventional one foot after another.


LMP (EVA)
It's hard saying what a sane pace might be. I think it's the one that I'm using now - would get rather tiring after several hundred *** but this may be a function of this suit, as well as lack of gravity forces.


CC
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Could we get both of you on the camera for a minute, please?


CDR (EVA)
Say again, Houston.


CC
Roger. We'd like to get both of you in the field of view of the camera for a minute.


CC
Neil and Buzz, the President of the United States is in his office now and would like to say a few words to you. Over.


CDR (EVA)
That would be an honor.


CC
Go ahead, Mr. President. This is Houston. Out.


THE FOLLOWING IS A MESSAGE FROM RICHARD M. NIXON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES; THE MESSAGE ORIGINATED FROM THE OVAL ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA


PRESIDENT NIXON
Neil and Buzz, I am talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you *** for every American. This has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they, too, join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one; one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.


CDR (EVA)
Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here representing not only the United States but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and a curiosity and a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.


PRESIDENT NIX0N
And thank you very much and I look forward - All of us look forward to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.


LMP (EVA)
I look forward to that very much, sir.

LMP (EVA)
Houston, it's very interesting to note that when I kick my foot *** with no atmosphere here, and this gravity *** they seem to leave, and most of them have about the same angle of departure and velocity.

CMP (COLUMBIA)
So be it.


LMP (EVA)
I've noticed several times in going from the sunlight into the shadow, that just as I go in, I catch an additional reflection off the LM *** along with the reflection off my face onto the visor, makes visibility very poor just at the transition *** sunlight into the shadow. I essentially have so much glare coming onto my visor *** shadow *** helmet actually gets the shadow.

Then, after being out in the sunlight a while, it takes - Watch it, Neil! Neil, you're on the cable.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Yes. Lift up your right foot, right foot. It's still - your toe is still hooked in it.


CDR (EVA)
That one?


LMP (EVA)
Yes. It's still hooked in it. Wait a minute. Okay. You're clear now.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







CDR (EVA)
Thank you.

Now, let's move that over this way.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I've got it.

CC
Buzz, this is Houston. You're cutting out on the end of your transmissions. Can you speak a little more closely into your microphone? Over.


LMP (EVA)
Roger. I'll try that.


CC
Beautiful.


LMP (EVA)
Well, I had that one inside my mouth that time.


CC
It sounded a little wet.


LMP (EVA)
In general, time spent in the shadow doesn't seem to have any *** thermal effects. *** inside the suit. There is a difference, of course, in the ... radiation and the helmet. So I think there's a tendency to feel a little cooler in the shadow than the Sun.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia in Delta.

Roger. You should have VHF AOS with the LM right about now. VHF LOS will be about 40 minutes 15 seconds. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Thank you.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







LMP (EVA)
As I look around the area, the contrast, in general, is *** comes about completely by virtue of the shadow *** down Sun ... very light colored gray, light gray color, a halo around my own shadow, around the shadow of my helmet. Then, as I look off across *** the contrast becomes strongest in that the surrounding color is still fairly light.

LMP (EVA)
The panorama I'll be taking is about 30 or 40 feet out to plus ***


CC
Say again which strut, Buzz?


LMP (EVA)
The plus Z strut.


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
And right in this area, there are two craters. The one that's right in front of me now as I look off in about the eleven o'clock position from the spacecraft, about 30 to 35 feet ... There's several eral rocks and boulders 6 to 8 inches across ... sizes.


LMP (EVA)
I'm now in the area of the minus Y strut taking some ... photographs.


LMP (EVA)
How's the bulk sample coming, Neil?


CDR (EVA)
Bulk sample is just being sealed.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. No marks on the LM that time. I did see a suspiciously small white object whose coordinates are - -


CC
Go ahead with the coordinates on the small white object.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Easy - Easy 0.3, 7.6, but I ... right on the southwest end of a crater. I think they would know it if they were in such a location. It looks like their LM would be pitched up quite a degree. It's on the southwest wall of a smallish crater.


CC
Roger. Copy Echo 0.3 and 7.6, and -


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. While I'm talking to you, LOS will be at 111 19 31; AOS, 112 05 43. Over.


CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Did you copy LOS AOS times? Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Negative, Houston. You broke. Disregard. I'll get them off the flight plans.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
The jet deflector that's mounted on quad 1 seems to be a good bit more wrinkled *** right now on quad 4.


CC
You're breaking up again, Buzz.


LMP (EVA)
I say the jets deflector that's mounted on quad 4 seems to be - the surface of it seems lo be more wrinkled than the one that's on quad 1. Generally, underneath part of the LM seems to have stood up quite well to the *** get some pictures in the aft part of the LM that will illuminate the thermal effects much better than we could get them up here in the front.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
We're going to get some particular photographs of the bulk sample area, Neil?


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
And, Houston? Buzz here. I'm showing 3.78 psi, 63 percent, no flags, adequate, slight warming *** fingered.


CDR (EVA)
Roger. And Neil has 66 percent O2, no flags, minimum cooling, and the suit pressure is 382.


CC
Houston. Roger. Out.


CC
Buzz, this is Houston. Have you removed the closeup camera from the MESA yet? Over.


LMP (EVA)
Negative. Thank you.


LMP (EVA)
*** get the panorama now. Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Did you get it?


CDR (EVA)
Houston, how does our timeline appear to be going?


CC
Roger. It looks like you're about a half hour slow on it. We're working on consumables. Over.


CDR (EVA)
All right.


CC
Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. To clarify my last, your consumables are in good shape at this time. The 30 minute reference was with respect to the nominal timeline. Over.


CDR (EVA)
Roger. I understand that.


CDR (EVA)
I don't note any abnormalities in the LM. The pods seem to be in good shape. The primary and secondary struts are in good shape. Atennas are all in place. There's no evidence of problem underneath the LM due to engine exhaust or drainage of any kind.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
It's very surprising, the very surprising lack of penetration of all four of the foot pads. I'd say if we were to try and determine just how far below the surface they would have penetrated, you'd measure maybe 3 inches, wouldn't you say, Neil?


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







CDR (EVA)
At the most, yes. That Y strut there is probably even less than that.


LMP (EVA)
Nice paint job.


LMP (EVA)
I get a picture of the plus Y strut taken from near the descent stage, and I think we'll be able to see a little bit better what the thermal effects are. Seem to be quite minimal.


LMP (EVA)
There's one picture taken in the right rear of the spacecraft looking at the skirt of the descent stage, shows a quite darkening of the surface color, a rather minimal amount of radiating or etching away or erosion of the surface. 0n descent, both of us remarked that we could see a large amount of very fine dust particles moving out. It was reported beforehand that we would probably see an upgassing from the surface after actual engine shutdown, but as I recall, I was unable to confirm that.


LMP (EVA)
This is too big an angle, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Yes. I think you are right.


LMP (EVA)
We're back at the minus Z strut now. *** very little force of impact that we actually had.


LMP (EVA)
And, Neil, if you'll take the camera, I'll get to work on the SEQ bay.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. I notice that -


CC
Go ahead, Buzz.


LMP (EVA)
Taking some close up pictures of that rock.


LMP (EVA)
I was saying that, Houston, *** stop and take a photograph or something and then want to start moving again sideways, there's quite a tendency to start doing it with just gradual sideways hops until you start getting ***


CC
Roger.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







LMP (EVA)
Can you see us underneath the LM over at the SEQ bay, Houston?


CC
Yes indeed, Buzz. We can see your feet sticking our underneath the structure of the LM descent stage.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I'm just on the other side of the - -


CC
Now we can see you through the structure of the minus Z secondary strut.


LMP (EVA)
All right. The doors are open, and it looks like they are going to stay up without any problem.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. We are about to lose you on the OMNI's. Request high gain antenna, REACQ mode Fish 20, yaw 135. Over.


LMP (EVA)
You want to pick an area, Neil?


CC
Make that yaw 175, Columbia, yaw 175 on the high gain.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Columbia is locked up on the high gain, Houston.


CC
Roger. Out.


LMP
Houston, the passive seismometer has been deployed manually.


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
And the manual deployment of the LR cubed, the little spring that is at the end of the string is pulled off of the picks head. However, I was able to reach up and get hold of the picks head and pull it loose. So, it will be deployed manually, also.


CC
Roger.


CDR (EVA)
And, the panorama is complete. *** and the LM - got the LM at 7 30 position at about 60 feet.


CDR (EVA)
And the doors are closed and locked.


CC
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
Have you got us a good area picked out?







CDR (EVA)
Yes. I think right out on that rise out there is probably as good as any.


CDR (EVA)
I'll probably stay on the high ground there and - -


LMP (EVA)
Watch it; the edge of that crater is - drops - -


CDR (EVA)
Yes. It drops off there, doesn't it?


LMP (EVA)
Get a couple of close ups on these quite rounded large boulders.


CDR (EVA)
About 40 feet out - I'd say out at the end of that next - -


LMP (EVA)
It's going to be a little difficult to find a good level spot here.


CDR (EVA)
The top of that next little ridge there. Wouldn't that be a pretty good place?


LMP (EVA)
All right. Should I put the LR cubed right about here?


CDR (EVA)
All right.


LMP (EVA)
I'm going to have to get on the other side of this rock here.


CDR (EVA)
I would go right around that crater to the left there. Isn't that a level spot there?


LMP (EVA)
I think this right here is just as level.


CDR (EVA)
These boulders look like basalt, and they have probably 2 percent white minerals in them, the white crystals. And the thing that I reported as the vesicular before, I'm not - I don't believe I believe that any more. I think that small craters - they look like little impact craters where shot - B B shot has hit the surface.


LMP (EVA)
Houston. I have the seismic experiment flipped over now, and I'm aligning it, but I'm having a little bit of difficulty getting the B B in the center. It wants to move around and around on the outside. ***


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







CC
You're cutting out again, Buzz.


LMP (EVA)
Roger. I say I'm not having too much success in leveling the PSE experiment.


CDR (EVA)
The laser reflector is installed and the bubble is leveled and the alignment appears to be good.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Roger. Out.


LMP (EVA)
Hey, you want to take a look at this B B and see what you make out of it?


CDR (EVA)
I find it pretty hard to get perfectly level, too.


LMP (EVA)
That B B likes the outside. It won't go on the inside.


CDR (EVA)
That little cup is convex now, instead of concave.


LMP (EVA)
I think you're right.


CDR (EVA)
Believe it is.


LMP (EVA)
Houston, I don't think there's any hope for using this leveling device to come up with an accurate level. It looks to me as though the cup here that the B B is in is now convex instead of concave. Over.


CC
Roger, 11. Press on. If you think it looks level by eyeball, go ahead.


LMP (EVA)
Okay.


CDR (EVA)
...


CDR (EVA)
There you go. Good work; good show. Hey, whoa; stop, stop! Back up.


LMP (EVA)
Houston, as I was spacing the PSE, the right hand solar array deployed automatically. The left hand I had to manually *** the bar at the far end.


LMP (EVA)
All parts of the solar array are clear of the ground now.


CC
Buzz, this is Houston. I understand that you did successfully deploy both solar arrays. Over.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







LMP (EVA)
Roger. That's affirmative. And there isn't any way of telling whether that's lined up. I'm getting in the way; maybe I can get down here.


LMP (EVA)
Neil, how does that appear to be pointing?


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Over.


CDR (EVA)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. We've been looking at your consumables, and you're in good shape. Subject to your concurrence, we'd like to extend the duration of the EVA 15 minutes from nominal. We will still give Buzz a hack at 10 minutes for heading in. Your current elapsed time is 2 plus 12. Over.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. That sounds fine.


CC
Roger. Out.


CC
Buzz, this is Houston. If you're still in the vicinity of the PSE, could you get a photograph of the ball level? Over.


CDR (EVA)
I'll do that, Buzz.


LMP (EVA)
Right. We'll get a photograph of that. Houston, what time would you estimate we could allow for the documented sample? Over.


CDR (EVA)
Oh, shoot. Would you believe the ball is right in the middle now?


LMP (EVA)
Wonderful. Take a picture before it moves.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. We're estimating about 10 minutes for the documented sampling. Over.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)

Roger.


CC
Buzz, this is Houston. You've got about 10 minutes left now prior to commencing your EVA termination activities. Over.


LMP (EVA)
Roger. I understand.


CC

LMP (EVA)
Houston, were you able to record the documentary way where the two core tube samples were taken?


CC
Negative. Out.


CDR (EVA)
I didn't get a stereopair of those two, but they are right in the vicinity of the solar wind.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. After you've got the core tubes and the solar wind, anything else that you can throw into the box would be acceptable.


CDR (EVA)
Righto.

I got the cap.


CDR (EVA)
Got the cap?


LMP (EVA)
They're both good caps on ...

CC
Buzz, this is Houston. It's about time for you to start your EVA closeout activities.


LMP (EVA)
Roger. That's in progress.


CC
Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. We'd like to remind you of the closeup camera magazine before you start up the ladder, Buzz.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Got that over with you, Neil?


CDR (EVA)
No, the closeup camera's underneath the MESA. I'll have to pick it up with the prong. I'm picking up several pieces of really vesicular rock out here, now.


LMP (EVA)
You didn't get anything in those environmental samples, did you?


CDR (EVA)
Not yet.







LMP (EVA)
Well, I don't think we'll have time.


CC
Roger, Neil and Buzz. Let's press on with getting the closeup camera magazine and closing out of the sample return container. We're running a little low on time.


LMP (EVA)
Roger.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Can you quickly stick this in my pocket, Neil, and I'll head on up the ladder?


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
I'll hold it. You open the packet up.


CDR (EVA)
... that'd kill us. Just hold it right there. Okay. Let the pocket go.


LMP (EVA)
About through?


CDR (EVA)
Got it.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Adios, amigo.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Anything more before I head on up, Bruce?


CC
Negative. Head on up the ladder, Buzz.


LMP (EVA)
How are you coming, Neil?


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


CDR (EVA)
Did you get that solar wind rolled up there, Buzz?


LMP (EVA)
Right. That's it right there.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Think you can reach the - reach this hook that's hanging over here? You might entertain the idea of sending up the second one that way.


CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Get the film off of that.


CDR (EVA)
I will. Get that up now.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I'm heading on in.







CDR (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
And I'll get the LEC all ready for the rock box.


CC
Neil, this is Houston. Did the Hasselblad magazine go up on that sample return container also?


CDR (EVA)
I've got the Hasselblad magazine hooked to the SRC now, yes.


CC
Roger.


CDR (EVA)
How are you doing, Buzz?


LMP (EVA)
I'm okay.


LMP (EVA)
About ready to send up the LEC?


CDR (EVA)
Yes. Just about.


LMP (EVA)
Okay.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. That's got it clear.


CDR (EVA)
Oh. Uh - oh. The camera came off. I mean the film pack came off.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Just ease it down now. Don't pull so hard on it. All right, let it go.


CDR (EVA)
While you're getting that, I've got to get the camera.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. This - This one's in. No problem.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. Stand by a second.

CC
Neil and Buzz, for your information, your consumables remain in good shape. Out.


LMP (EVA)
Roger, How's it coming, Neil?


CDR (EVA)
Okay. I've got one side hooked up to the second box and I've got the film pack on.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Good.







CDR (EVA)
Boy, that bilge from on the LEC is kind of falling all over me while I'm doing this.


LMP (EVA)
All that soot, huh?


CDR (EVA)
That's what it looks like down here.


LMP (EVA)
I think my watch stopped, Neil.


CDR (EVA)
Did it?


LMP (EVA)
No, it didn't either. Second hand.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. If you can just kind of hold it, why, I think I can do the pulling.


CDR (EVA)
Okay. Stand by a minute. Let me move back.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. Easy. All right, easy in the hatch now.


LMP (EVA)
Okay. I'll get it the rest of the way. And I'll give it to you to - No, wait, just a second. Yes, a little more.

Buzz?


LMP (EVA)
Okay. It's unhooked.

Thank you. Am I bumping now?


LMP (EVA)
No, you're clear. You're rubbing up against me a little bit.

CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. We're planning on doing that. I was just wondering how much longer we want to wait, though. We've probably got another half an hour's worth of picture taking, and I guess we could run through an eat cycle and then change the canister, and then DEPRESS. Over.

Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. On your next depressurization, it's acceptable to use the overhead hatch dump valve in addition to or instead of the forward hatch dump valve to speed up the depressurization of the cabin. I have a T13 update for you, and if you could, sometime here, give us P00 and DATA; we'll uplink you a new CSM state vector. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
All right.


LMP (TRANQ)
You've got the DSKY.


CC
Roger. Your T13 time is 124 22 02. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. It's T13, 124 22 - is that 02? Over.


CC
That's affirmative. That is 02. And do you have a time estimate for us until you're ready to start cabin DEPRESS? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Fifteen minutes, maybe?


CC
Roger.


CC
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Uplink complete. The computer's yours, and you can go out of DATA.

Roger. Just want to let you guys know that since you're an hour and a half over your timeline and we're all taking a day off tomorrow, we're going to leave you. See you later.


CDR (TRANQ)
I don't blame you a bit.


CC
That's a real great day, guys. I really enjoyed it.


CDR (TRANQ)
Thank you. You couldn't have enjoyed it as much as we did.


CC
Roger.


LMP (TRANQ)
It was great.


CC
Sure wish you'd hurry up and get that trash out out of there, though.


CDR (TRANQ)
Yes. We're just about to do it.


CC
Okay.

Roger. We've sucessfully reacquired high gain antenna. Unless you have some other traffic with us, I guess we'll bid you a good night and let you get some sleep, Mike. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Sounds fine.


CC
And we're going to power down the voice subcarrier part of our uplink to you in order that we don't disturb you while we're talking to Tranquility Base. If you need us, just give us







a call, and we can respond with a time lag of about a minute to a minute and a half in setting reconfigured. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Thank you.


CC
Roger. And good night.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Good night, Bruce. Thanks a lot.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. We'd like you to ENABLE the thrusters in Bravo 1 and Bravo 2, AUTO RCS SELECT. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Bravo 1 and Bravo 2 ENABLE.


CC
Roger. Out.


CC
Tranquility, this is Houston. For a reference, which dump valve are you using? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
We used the forward dump valve until about 2 psi, and we're using the overhead now.


CC
Roger. Out.


CDR (TRANQ)
They're both - they're both open now.

Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. When you get back into your surface checklist and come over to the COMM reconfiguration on page Surface 45, we'd like you to enable the ranging feature on your S band. That is, when you come down to S band configuration, instead of CAUTION and WARNING ELECTRONICS, ENABLE TV, we'd like you to go into the RANGE position and leave it there for as long as you conveniently can until you get ready to commence your rest period; and we'll try to get a little more ranging data on you. Over.

CC
Roger. On your mission timer, we wanted to pull the circuit breaker and let it cool down for an hour and a half to 2 hours. I believe the breaker is currently open. It has been off, so go ahead and reset the mission timer circuit breaker. Put the timer control to RESET and hold it in RESET for 30 seconds, and then slew it to your desired settings left to right, and place the timer control to START. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. We'll try it.


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, our mission timer seems to be slewing okay. You want to give us a time hack? Or can we get it off the CMC   LGC, I mean?

CC
Roger. Out.


CC
Tranquility, this is Houston. We also have a set of about 10 questions relating to observations you made, things you may have seen during the EVA. You can either discuss a little later on this evening or sometime later in the mission at your option. How do you feel? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
I guess we can take them up now.


CC
Okay. And your friendly Green Team here has pretty well been relieved by your friendly Maroon Team, and I'll put Owen on with the questions.


CC
Tranquility - -


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Go ahead.







CC
Tranquility, Houston. First question here is how your best estimate of the yaw on the - of the LM as compared to the nominal preflight plan. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
We got 13 degrees left on the ball, and I think that's probably about right. Looking at the shadow and so on, we prob - probably about 13 degrees left of the shadow.


CC
Roger. That's 13 degrees left of the shadow. And, next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near the first part of the EVA and any changes in composition that you might have observed during the bulk sampling interval. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
I'm not sure I understand that question, but we got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizable number of selected rock fragments of different types.


CC
Roger, Neil. One of the implications here is the depth from which the bulk sample was collected. Did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
We got some down from as much as 3 inches in the area where I was looking at variation with depth in the bulk sample. There really wasn't appreciable difference, and I didn't run into any hard bed. Later on, or at some other times and other areas, why, I'd get down just a short distance, an inch or two, and couldn't go any further.


CC
Roger. Believe we understand down as deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition to that depth. Next question, the - the second SRC was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation, and wonder if you would be able to provide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second SRC. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
We got two core tubes and solar wind and about half of the big sample bag full of assorted rocks which I picked up hurriedly from around the area. I tried to get as many representative types as I could.







CC
Roger, Neil. Next topic here relates to the rays which emanate from the DPS engine burning area. We're wondering if the rays emanating from the - beneath the engine are any darker or lighter than the surrounding surface. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
The ones that I saw back in the aft end of the spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker; of course, viewed from the aft end, why, they did have the Sun shining directly on them. It seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction, but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet, from the skirt of the engine. Over.


CC
Roger. Understand that near the aft end out to the east that the rays did appear darker. I understand, Buzz, that these were - this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending outward. Is that correct?


LMP (TRANQ)
No. I wouldn't say it was necessarily material that had been uncovered. I think some of the material might have been baked or in some way caused to be more cohesive and perhaps flow together in some way, I don't know. Now, in other areas, before we started trampling around out front, why, we could see that small erosion had taken place in a radially outward direction, but it had left no significant mark on the surface other than just having eroded it away. Now, it was different back in the - right under the skirt itself. It seems as though the surface had been baked in a streak fashion, and I think a couple of pictures on film will show this. But that didn't extend out very far. Over.


CC
Roger, Tranquility. And this baked appearance that you described, at least the suggestion is that it was due to the heat of the engine at any rate. Next subject, did - -


LMP (TRANQ)
I believe so.


CC
Roger. Next subject, did either of the solar panels on the PSE touch the surface of the Moon during deployment? Over.







LMP (TRANQ)
I think that two corners did touch, since when it was deployed, both of them didn't come out at the same time. It unfolded a little unevenly, and of course, the terrain that it was on was a little bit - not quite as level as it was - as I would like to have it. And I think that two corners did touch to about 1 inch - no, three quarters to a half an inch deep; and maybe along the bottom, it might have been maybe 3 inches, leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners; and I think these are on the western ones. Over.


CC
Roger. Understand the description there. And the next subject, on the two core tubes which you collected, how did the driving force required to collect these tubes compare? Was there any difference? Over


LMP (TRANQ)
Not significantly. I could get down to about the first 2 inches without much of a problem, and then as I would pound it in about as hard as I could do it, and the second one took two hands on the hammer, and I was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod, and it just wouldn't go much more than - I think the total depth might have been about 8 or 9 inches. But even there, it didn't - For some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. In other words, I'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't - just penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over, if that makes any sense at all. It didn't really to me. Over.


CC
Roger, Buzz. I think I've got the picture. You indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continue hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it in to a total depth of 8 or 9 inches, and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical, that they'd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far. Is that correct?


LMP (TRANQ)
Yes. That's about it. It wasn't a rapid change in resistive force. And also I noticed when I took the bit off that the material was quite well packed, a good bit darker, and it - The way it adhered to the core tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist. Over.







CC
Roger. Understand the general impression of being moist as it packed in the core tube. Next question: we did copy your comments prior to the EVA of your general description of the area. We wonder if either of you would have any more lengthy description or more detailed description of the general summary of the geology of the area. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Yes let's - we'll - We'll postpone our answer to that one until tomorrow. Okay?


CC
Yes, indeed. That'll be fine. Just a couple more here, and I think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there. Can you estimate the stroke of the primary and secondary struts? Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Well, I could do it like this, Owen. About all the struts are about equally stroked, and the height from the ground to the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 and 1/2 feet, huh?


CC
Roger. Understand, Neil. Next topic, as - just after landing, you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plus Z axis from the LM. Are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar ray during the sunset - as sunset approaches in your locality - Are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the ray? Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
No. I don't believe so, I think that it's - It's about as level as any other areas that we chose.


CC
Roger. I - -


LMP (TRANQ)
There's nothing large, anyway, that's going to get in the way.


CC
Roger. Copy. That's also the way it appeared from the television, I think. And now the final question. You commented, Neil, that on your approach to the landing spot, you had passed over a football field sized crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size. Can you estimate the distance to this football sized crater from your present position? Over.







CDR (TRANQ)
I thought we'd be close enough so that when we got outside we could see its rim back there but I couldn't. But I don't think that we're more than a half mile beyond it. That is a half mile west of it.


CC
Roger. So you estimate your present position less than half a mile approximately west of this large crater. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
That's correct.


CC
Okay. Well, that takes care of the questions from our geologists for tonight, and unless you have something else, that'll be all for - from us for the evening. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Thank you.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We've now collected all the ranging data that we can use, and you can go back to caution and warning ENABLE. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Will do.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. Two more verifications, here. Can you - will you verify that the disk with messages was placed on the surface as planned, and also that the items listed in the flight plan - all of those listed there were jettisoned. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
That's - All that's verified.


CC
Roger. Thank you, and I hope this will be a final good night.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay.

Columbia, Columbia, good morning from Houston.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Hi, Ron.


CC
Hey, Mike, how's it going this morning?


CMP (COLUMBIA)
How goes it?


CC
Hey, real fine. While you're - -


CMP (COLUMBIA)
I don't know yet, how's it going with you?


CC
Real fine here. Columbia, request P00 and ACCEPT. We'll shove the state vector in for you right away.


CC
Okay. It's coming up now, Columbia. We're going to keep you a little busy here. As soon as we get the state vector in, we'd like you to go ahead and do a P52 option 3 on this night pass, and then when you come on around the other side there, we'll give you some landmark tracking information on prime 130.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay.


CC
And for your information, we're also going to have Tranquility Base do a P52 when you come around the other time; and I have the P22 information if you're ready to copy.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead.


CC
Okay. Track landmark 130 prime using P22, and for information, this will properly position your rendezvous radar transponder. T1 is 122 plus 16 plus 05 - whoops, okay. Stand by.


CC
Columbia, Houston. The computer is yours.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. And I'd like the grid square of this crater 130 prime. Over.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Say again about 130 prime.







CMP (COLUMBIA)
I'd like its grid square, please.


CC
Roger. Stand by.


CC
Columbia, Houston.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. I have the T1 and T2 times and also the longitude of the 130 prime. We're working on the grid squares and we'll get them shortly.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Ready to copy.


CC
Okay. T1: 122 plus 16 plus 05. Tango 2 is 122 plus 21 plus 11, and 6 miles north of track. And do you want your NOUN 89 values?


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes, please.


CC
Roger. Latitudes, plus 01.243. Longitude over 2, plus 11.844. Altitude, minus 001.46. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Copy T1: 122 16 05. T2: 122 21 11, 6 miles north, NOUN 89 is plus 01243, plus 11844, minus 00146.


CC
Columbia, affirmative. And at the T1 time, put your rendezvous radar transponder switch to OPERATE.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
All right.


CC
And this 130 prime is the same one that you tracked prior to descent. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. You've updated your information as to the LM's position and this is your best estimate of where the LM is, is that correct?


CC
Columbia, that's negative. This 130 is the little bitty crater there that you tracked - John Young's crater - that you tracked prior to descent. And we want that - -


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Fine. Okay. You've given up looking for that.







CC
Affirmative. We want this for one last fix on your plane.


 CMP (COLUMBIA)
All right. Fine. Understand. Thank you.


CC
And when the LM does his P22 on your transponder, well then, that'll be our last shot at the LM's position.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Understand. Do you care whether my transponder is on before T1?


CC
Roger. It'll be on WARMUP prior to that time, and you can go to OPERATE anywhere around that time.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes. I gather it's on its 24 minute warmup now?


CC
Roger.


CC
And, Houston. The computer is yours, you can go to BLOCK anytime.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. BLOCK, going P52, option 3.


CC
Roger. And we'll see you coming around the other side. About 1 minute to go, and all your systems are looking good.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Thanks, Ron.

CDR (TRANQ)
Good morning, Houston. Tranquility Base. Over.


CC
Roger. Loud and clear. And how is the resting standing up there. Did you get a chance to curl up on the engine can?


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Neil has rigged himself a really good hammock with a waste tether, and he's been lying







on the ascent engine cover, and I curled up on the floor. Over.


CC
Roger. Copy, Buzz. Got a couple of changes to your surface checklist here, and in general, what we're going to want you to do is P22, tracking the command module for one last hack on your position there. And this will be - in other words, P57, P22, and then to press on with the checklist, and the rest of them are a couple of minor changes in the checklist. The main one being that we do not want the rendezvous radar on during the ascent, and we think that this will take care of some of the overflow of program alarms which we're getting during descent.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. We had the rendezvous radar in SLEW during descent, though.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. I missed that. Say again.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I say again. We had the rendezvous radar switch in the SLEW position, not the LGC position.


CC
Roger. We copy that. But there's a greater duty cycle on - There's a good 15 percent duty cycle on the ascent program there, so just go ahead and leave it off. And I have the changes there if you want to get out your surface checklist, and I can go ahead and start giving them to you.


CDR (TRANQ)
All right. Go ahead. I've got it out.


CC
Okay. Before we start here, request P00 and DATA, and we'll give you some vectors.


CDR (TRANQ)
Now you've got P00 and DATA.


CC
Okay. And on Surface 50 will be the first change there.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. And I understand you want us to do a P57 option 3 and then a P22, is that the general idea? Over.


CC
That's affirmative. So on Surface 50 there, down at the bottom of the page, just after PRO after two recycles, stick in a time of 122 plus 15; do P22 as per PGNS 20 of G&amp;N dictionary. Over.







CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Understand that's 122 15, do P22 as per PGNS 20, G&amp;N dictionary.


CC
Roger. Okay. Let's skip on over to Surface 59.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


CC
Okay. This is going to be for one last vent on the DPS tank there, so at the top of the page just after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add - Okay, after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add PROP DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT CLOSE, and then after STABILIZATION/CONTROL AELD, CLOSE, add PROP DISPLAYS/ENGINE 0VERRIDE/LOGIC, CLOSE. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Copy. These are two circuit breakers, right?


CC
Tranquility Base, affirmative. Those are just the circuit breakers at that time.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. Did you get those two on the propulsion circuit breakers?


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I have those two.


CC
Okay. Let's go over to Surface 60, and then down the middle of the page, after launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, then I add the switches there.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Go ahead then.


CC
Okay. After launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, add DESCENT PROPULSION FUEL VENT, OPEN; add DESCENT PROPULSION OXIDIZER VENT, OPEN; add verify talkback gray. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. DESCENT PROPELLANT FUEL VENT, OPEN; DESCENT PROPELLANT OXIDIZER VENT, OPEN; verify talkback gray.


CC
Roger. You got that one, so that'll be the last vent and it will continue venting. Skip over to Surface 61 down there at TIG minus 17.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I'm there. Go ahead.







CC
Okay, at TIG minus 17, delete CB (11). AC Bus A, RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE, wait 30 seconds; delete PGNS: RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE; and then add UP DATA LINK switch to VOICE BACKUP. Over


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I have that. We'll leave those two circuit breakers open, and have the UP DATA LINK to VOICE BACKUP; and we'll make the appropriate changes on the following circuit breaker status card.


CC
Roger. And then you might add a little note down there at the bottom of the page - Note: - This is at the bottom of page 61 - Note: Do not use tape meter in PGNS, i.e., do not place MODE SELECT switch to PGNS. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. We'll put it in AGS.


CC
Roger. Fair enough. That's some more of that computer load business.


CC
Okay. That's all the changes we have for the checklist here. I've got some - just some general notes, I'll read to you on P22, and just for some information. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Then it looks to me like we ought to get hopping on this P57.


CC
Roger. We agree wholeheartedly. And while you're starting on that, I'll read - just read these notes on P22. Call P22 possible program alarm 5.6, range greater than 400 nautical miles, and then use the P22 as described on PGNS 20. Take option 1 in NOUN 06, and use the no update mode. The rendezvous radar will lock on at about 25 degrees elevation above the horizon. If 503 alarm occurs, designate fail. Key a PROCEED and allow the rendezvous radar to search for the CSM. And place the range altitude monitor switch in altitude/altitude rate to prevent the tape meter from driving into the stops. And press on.

Houston, we'd like to check this on the tape meter against the AGS. We'll go back to altitude - altitude rates as soon as the rate starts to build up. Over.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Roger.


CDR (TRANQ)
On second thought, since that will peg the range rate, I guess maybe we'd better not do that. And







for this range that the AGS are showing now, 425 miles with a signal strength of 2.2. It looks like we ought to proceed on this. Over.


CC
Roger. Stand by one. Tranquility, affirmative. Proceed.


LMP (TRANQ)
Are you getting the information on the downlink now?


CC
Tranquility, affirmative, and we're saving it. We've got 4 so far, and it's looking good.


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. What do you people think about calling up a VERB 83?


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Stand by on that now. We're getting the data now. We're checking on the VERB 83.


LMP (TRANQ)
And we expect that we may lose lock when it passes overhead because of the MAX rate that the radar has.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Negative on VERB 83.


LMP (TRANQ)
Understand.


CDR (TRANQ)
We just lost lock.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Go.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
They've just lost lock, Ron.


CC
Roger. We had about 20 some points before you did that. And for your information, the reason the AGS is a little different there - The reason the AGS is a little different is because the K factor is a little bit wrong.


LMP (TRANQ)
Has he already gone? Over. Okay. Okay. Has he already gone overhead, or do you want us to try and get in lock on again?


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. You got NOUN 49. Five good marks.







CC
Tranquility, affirmative. Try to lock on again, and you'll lose him at about 29 minutes and 35 seconds.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Do you have a real quick procedure how to do that?


CC
Columbia, Houston. Say again about your NOUN 49.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
I say I got five good marks. You got NOUN 49. When you get everything you need off the downlink, let me know.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Stand by one.


CDR (TRANQ)
Ron, did you say on the 526 alarm to proceed or do a VERB 32?


CC
Roger. It's just that radar thinks the range is greater than 400 miles now.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. Recommend you terminate P22. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Will do.


CC
And, Columbia, Houston. Same for you. You can terminate P22.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
I have. I'm running fast.


CC
Roger.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
I'm staying in P22 here a second just to record the NOUN 89 and then over VERB 34.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy, and that's good.


CC
Tranquility, Houston.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Go ahead.


CC
Roger. Request S BAND FUNCTION switch to RANGE. We're going to do some ranging on you. Also, I have an updated AGS K factor when you are ready to copy. Over.







CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Go ahead with the K factor.


CC
Roger. 119 plus 59 plus 59.92. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. A little closer this time.


CC
Yes. It sure is.


LMP (TRANQ)
119 59 5992. Over.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Readback correct.


CC
Columbia, Houston - -


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility. I see what you mean now about the K factor.


CC
Roger.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
This is Columbia. Go ahead. And I'd like to know about this P52 coming up. Is that the one I just completed or do you want a pair of them back to back?


CC
Columbia, Houston. You do not need to do another P52 unless you want to. Break. And also, Columbia, when you get a chance, request BATT C and the PYRO readouts. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
BATT C says 37 volts even. PYRO A, 37. PYRO B, 37.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy. Thank you.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
BATT bus B is 37. BATT bus A is 36, or I'd think the gauge is stuck.


CC
Roger. And you're looking good to us - to us, Columbia.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes sir. Keep it that way.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Columbia is coming up on a VERB 45 ENTER to reset the surface flag.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Negative. Stand by on the VErB 45.







CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger that.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
And a crew status report from Columbia. I figure I got about 5 hours' good sleep, although you guys probably know better than I do.


CC
Columbia. Roger. We copy.


CC
Columbia, Houston. We've got a couple more vectors to send up to you. They'll be coming up shortly and then you can do the VERB 45 after you get those in. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. That's fine. Just wanted to make sure that we're both in SYNC on the order.


CC
Roger.


CC
Columbia and Tranquility Base, this is Houston. In case you haven't noticed, the MSFN relay is not activated, so I can go ahead and relay anything if you want to talk directly.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Columbia. Roger.


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility. Be advised we've got - -


CMP (COLUMBIA)
...


CDR (TRANQ)
Coming ... on schedule - - showing red right now. We just put a VERB 77 in. I believe that there's ... let me check here.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We've got a lot of static down here. Could you say again?


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. We have four out of eight circuit breaker talkbacks indicating red. We still have the circuit breakers out as of right now. I believe at this moment we have just entered VERB 77 on tape 3052 and are ready to proceed with the hot fire. Is it normal to have these four red flags? Over.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We think that's okay. Go ahead and reset them and press on with the hot fire. Over.







CC
Roger. They are reset.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Request P00 and ACCEPT, and we'll send some state vectors up to you.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Here we going P00 and ACCEPT.


CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility. I used Capella in the last sighting, and it's a good ways near the edge. A good ways away from the center of detent 4. I'm wondering if it would pay any to use Alpheratz, star number 1. It might be a little closer. However, it would delay things a little, since I'd have to designate the radar out of the way. Over.


CC
Tranquility. Roger. We copy. Stand by 1. And, break, break, Columbia. We're having a little trouble getting the stuff in there. Request high gain, pitch minus 20, yaw plus 150. Over.


CC
And, Tranquility, Houston. We'd prefer to save the time; press on with Capella. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger.


CC
And, Tranquility, Houston. The RCS check looked mighty fine to us.


CDR (TRANQ)
It looks good up here.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Over.


CC
Columbia, Houston in the blind - high gain. Pitch minus 20, yaw plus 150.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility. Could you give me the fixed portion of the ascent PAD so I can load it in for a P57? Over.


CC
Tranquility. Roger. Stand by one. We want to wait on that P57 until about TIG minus 50 minutes. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger.







CC
Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.


CC
Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility. It turns out that detent 4 isn't usable anyway with the yaw that we have, because the Earth appears in both detent 2 and detent 3.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. Roger.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Over.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. I have your LM ascent and CSI data PAD's when you are ready to copy.

Eagle and Columbia, this is the backup crew. Our congratulations for yesterday's performance, and our prayers are with you for the rendezvous. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Thank you, Jim.


LMP (TRANQ)
Thank you, Jim.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Glad to have all you big room full of people looking over our shoulder.


CDR (TRANQ)
We had a lot of help down there, Jim.







CDR (TRANQ)
And, Houston, Tranquility Base is going to give you a few comments with regard to the geology question of last night. We are landed in a relatively smooth crater field of elongate secondary - circular secondary craters, most of which have rims irrespective of their - raised rims irrespective of their size. That's'not universally true. There are - There are a few of the smaller craters around which do not have a discernable rim. The ground mass throughout the area is a very fine sand to a silt. I'd say the thing that would be most like it on Earth is powdered graphite. Immersed in this ground mass are a wide variety of rock shapes, sizes, textures, rounded and angular, many with varying consistencies. As I said, I've seen plain - what looked to be plain basalt and vesicular basalt. Others with no crystals, some with small white phenocrysts, maybe one to less than 5 percent. And the bould - we are in a boulder field where the boulders range generally up to 2 feet with a few larger than that. Now, some of the boulders are lying on top of the surface, some are partially exposed, and some are just barely exposed. And in our traverse around on the surface and particularly working with the scoop, we've run into boulders below the surface - it was probably buried under several inches of the ground mass.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. Roger. Very fine description.


CDR (TRANQ)
I suspect this boulder field may have some of its origin with this large sharp edged rocky rim crater that we passed over at final descent. Now yesterday I said that was about the size of a football field, and I have to admit it was a little - little hard to measure coming in. But I thought that it might just fit in the Astrodome as we came by it. And the rocks in the vicinity of the - of this rocky rim crater are much larger than these in this area. Some are 10 feet or so and perhaps bigger, and they are very thickly populated out to about one crater diameter beyond the crater rim. Beyond that, there is some diminishing, and even out in this area the blocks seem to run out in rows with irregular patterns, and then there are paths between them where there are considerably less surface evidence of hard rocks. Over.







CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We copy. Thank you very much.


CC
And, Tranquility Base, we're through with the ranging. You can take your S band function switch to OFF RESET.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger.


CC
And, Tranquility, I have a LM consumables update for you.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Ready to copy.


CC
Okay. At 123 plus 00, RCS Alfa 78 - 78 percent PQMD, Bravo is 76 percent PQMD, descent O2 is 62 percent - 62 percent. Descent ampere hours are 590, 590 remaining, ascent ampere hours are 574, 574 remaining. Over.


CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Copy. Sounds very good. Thank you.


CC
Roger.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston.


CDR (TRANQ)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. For your P57 ..., we did a little looking around, and it looks like Sirius and Rigel out at detent 6 would be real good on that. The Sun angle on Sirius is about 43 degrees, and on Rigel, it's about 55 degrees. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger, Houston. The only trouble is that the Sun is in number 5, the closed one. And it appears to also be close enough to detent 6 to shine on the far side of the cone. And it completely obscures detent 6. I'm - unable to use that at all.


CC
Okay. We understand it now, and thank you.


CC
Tranquility, Houston. For your information, the circuitry looks real fine on that ascent engine arm circuit breaker.







LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. I don't think I could get it out now if I wanted to.


CC
Roger. We copy.


LMP (TRANQ)
And it looks like in detent 6 I can pick up Venus right at the fringe, but I can't get anything else.


CC
Roger.


CDR (TRANQ)
And by the way, Houston, our EVA antenna did retract.


CC
Roger. Mighty fine. Thank you.


CC
Tranquility, Houston.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Go ahead.


CC
Roger. It looks like you're going to have to reposition the radar here. We suggest you may want to start your TIG minus 45 minute - that point in the checklist at about TIG minus 50. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Why do you think I need to move the radar?


CC
Well, we thought that you probably wouldn't be able to get the star there.


LMP (TRANQ)
On the rear detent, the radar can be pointing plus X, and I'm - I'll be using right rear. That's okay.


CC
Roger. That's fine then.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. I have one more late checklist change there on the rendezvous radar position for lift off. Over. From page Surface 57.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Go ahead.


CC
Okay. On Surface 57 there on your VERB 21 NOUN 73 trunnion, leave it 180; the shaft we'd like 335. Over.







LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Understand. Shaft 335.


CC
Roger. And if the steerable doesn't quite hack it on lift off, looks like the forward OMNI is good for about 30 to 60 seconds after lift off. And then the aft OMNI antenna is good for the rest of the ascent. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Copy.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, we've got two angles here at 3 minutes in ascent. Would you confirm those? Pitch 134 and yaw minus 32. Over.


CC
Tranquility Base. Roger. We verify; those are correct.


CC
Tranquility Base, Houston.


CDR (TRANQ)
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. Eagle's looking real fine to us down here. We have a fairly high confidence that we know the position of the LM. However, it is possible that we may have a planes change, but the - In the worst case, it would be up to 30 feet per second. And, of course, we don't expect that at all.


BEGIN LUNAR REV 25


CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility Base. Since we've still got plenty of time I think I'll go ahead and recycle on this 604.


CC
Tranquility. Roger. That's okay with us, and we assume that the primary canister is still aboard. Is this correct?


LMP (TRANQ)
We have one primary canister on board and one secondary. The other primary is - out in front of the Z - plus - Z pad. Over.


CC
Roger. We copy. Thank you.

CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility. We're not sure that we got number 2 tank to fire. It's still showing a high pressure.


CC
Roger. We confirm that. Try it again.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. We'll go to number 2 this time.


CC
Roger. we concur.


LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. No problem.


LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, looks like there's very little difference between the two.


CC
Roger.


LMP (TRANQ)
We've got number 2 reading 3050 and number 1 is reading - 3000 and it drops down to 2990.







So I'm not sure that it's really indicative that it didn't go. Over.


CC
Roger. We copy and we agree.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. I assume we're - we're GO for lift off, and we'll proceed with the ascent feed.


CC
Roger. That's correct, and we'll go ahead and watch tank 2. If it doesn't - tank 2 doesn't decrease, we'll tell you to close the ascent feeds and open the shutoffs. Over.


LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Ascent feeds are open and shutoffs are closed.

CC
Roger. Eagle, Columbia says your Y dot is minus 1.0. Over.


CDR (EAGLE)
Roger, Houston. We got that. Thank you.


CC
Roger. And you can go high bit rate now. Eagle can.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Eagle, Columbia. How do you read?


LMP (EAGLE)
AGS agrees very closely, and pointing ...


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia is unable to read Eagle on either antenna or on VHF duplex Bravo. You got any suggestions?


CC
Roger. Columbia, we understand. You are unable to read Eagle. Stand by.


CDR (EAGLE)
Houston, tell Columbia that we read him about strength 2.


LMP (EAGLE)
Okay. Wide deadband on.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. Also my VHF ranging is not working now, and I'd like to know whether you'd like me to continue making sextant marks or do nothing. I'm supposed to be doing VHF marks only, and it's for the next 6 or 7 minutes.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy. And, Eagle, looks like the best antenna would be forward for the LM. And, break. Eagle, we missed your loading of the TPI TIG and P32. Could you confirm you've done that?


CC
Columbia, Houston. Recommend you take sextant marks and do not reinitialize. Over.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger, Houston. Columbia's got the VHF ranging back now. I'll stick with the nominal. Thank you.







CC
Roger. Mighty fine.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Columbia reading you loud and clear now, Eagle.


CC
Columbia, Houston.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. Mike, you can go ahead and get as many VHF and sextant marks as you can here in this period of time.


CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. I've just got time for maybe two sextant marks, then get on with the final count.


CC
Eagle and Columbia, about 1 minute till LOS there on Columbia. It looks like we have about 51.5 for CSI, and we tend to confirm your Y dot. And, break. For Eagle, verify VHF Bravo transmitter is off.


LMP (EAGLE)
Roger. VHF Bravo is off.


CC
Eagle, Houston. Recommend aft OMNI and are you GO for CSI, so we can let Columbia know. Over.


LMP (EAGLE)
Roger. We're GO for CSI.

CC
Eagle, Houston. Stand by. We'll check it. And, Eagle, Houston. Can you give us a burn report?







LMP (EAGLE)
Roger. Stand by.


LMP (EAGLE)
Okay. The CSI burn was on scheduled time of 125 19 3470, 51.5 feet per second was our solution. After chasing residuals a little bit, we ended up with a minus 0.2, plus 0.7, and minus 0.1. And in the AGS, at that time, we had plus 0.4, plus 0.9, and plus 0.3.

I'm pumping up cabin pressure.







CMP
That was a funny one. You know, I didn't feel it shock, and I thought things were pretty steady. I went to RETRACT there, and that's when all hell broke loose. Were you guys - did it appear to you to be - that you were jerking around quite a bit during the retrack cycle?


CDR
Yes. It seemed to happen at the time I put the plus X thrust to it, and apparently it wasn't centered, because somehow or other I accidentally got off in attitude and then the attitude hold system started firing.

LMP
Okay. Any particular attitude you would like the PGNS in when we do that?


LMP
No. We're not getting any. Could you give us some course align gimbal angles to move the PGNS to, and then we will align the AGS to the PGNS. Over.


CC
Roger. Eagle. We concur. Stand by on the gimbal angles. And also, Eagle, while we've got the command module direct O2 on there, there's a possibility that your cabin relief might relieve if we get up around cabin pressure of about 5.4 or 5.5.


LMP

Now, you might want to take into account what will happen when the CSM maneuvers to jettison attitude.







CC
Eagle, Houston. We don't care what - All we are trying to do is get a drift rate and see how long it takes them to drift apart on the thing after you jettison.


LMP
Okay. Will we be jettisoning at about this attitude? That's okay. I'll align the AGS with the PGNS. You can tell me a little later if you need some help.

Roger. Neil, just a reminder again, the ACA out of detent to zero; the AGS out of there just in case you go to ATTITUDE HOLD shortly.


CDR
Okay.


CMP
You say you wanted the probe now?


CC
Eagle, Houston.


CDR
Houston, Eagle. Go ahead.


CC
Roger. That ACA out of detent didn't quite do it because the mode control switches were off. Request guidance control to PGNS and then back to AGS, and that will zero the AGS, there. Over.


CDR
Say again, please.


CC
Roger. Request guidance control switch to PGNS and then back to AGS. Over.

Okay. We still have both mode control switches off. Over.

Roger, Eagle. Correction - Roger, Columbia. We copy. You guys are speedy; you beat us to the punch. We had a couple of things for you.


CDR
What are they?


CC
Oh, it was just - We wanted you to close the CO2 sensor breaker and give us an RCS onboard readout out of Eagle, but that's all. Columbia, Houston. We've got a state vector for you if you'll give us P00 in ACCEPT. Over.


CDR
Buzz says the CO2 sensor circuit breaker is IN

CC
Columbia, Houston. It looks like you guys are so speedy on us that we're thinking about moving up jettison time to about a GET of 130 plus 30, if that's okay with you all. Over.


CMP
That's fine. I've still got to get a P30 PAD from you.


CC
Roger. We want to talk to you about that. Mike, we can - for your druthers, we can do it either way. We can either let you do it in the jettison in P30 - correction P47, or we can send you a P30 target load up and then you - let you call P41, whichever you want to do. Over.


CMP
Yes, I see. Ron was going to give me a P30 PAD and the flight plan says P47. Out of the two, I prefer to go to P30, P41 route.


CC
Roger. Beautiful. We've got the load. If you'll give us P00 and ACCEPT, we'll send you a load up. Stand by.


CC
Columbia, Houston. We'd like you to terminate direct O2 flow, and stand by on your P00 and ACCEPT. We'll have to generate a new load due to the moveup on time. Over.


CMP
Roger.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Over.


CMP
Go ahead.


CC
Roger, Mike. It looks like if we move up this jettison time and give you a new load, it would require a new attitude, and we can't do that due to the LM already closed out, and it would fight us all the way around and we'd lose COMM with it. We're thinking separating in P47 in about 10 minutes. We're looking at trajectories and we'll be right with you momentarily. Over.


CMP
Okay. It's no big thing with me either way.


CC
Roger.


CC
Hello, Columbia. Houston. We'd like you to start down your jettison checklist. We recommend


CC
Columbia, Houston. Don't try to chase it, just hold what you've got.


LMP
Charlie, did it hold cabin pressure this time?


CC
Say again, Buzz. Over.


LMP
Okay. I thrusted back - I thrusted back toward it a little bit, Charlie, and I'm now reading NOUN 83, plus four balls 4, minus four balls 8, and you want me to kill average D. Right?


CC
Stand by. That's affirmative. You can exit P47.


CDR
There she goes. It was a good one.


CC
Roger dodger. We got Eagle looking good. It's holding cabin pressure and it picked up about 2 feet per second from that jettison.


LMP
I believe that. I can see some cracks on the outer coating around the tunnel. In the thermal protective covering, I don't think it has anything to do with the structure.


CC
Roger.


CC
Hello, Columbia, Houston. We'll have an attitude and a little blip burn for you in about 130 30, so we can separate from Eagle. Over.


CMP
That's fine.


CC
Columbia, Houston. Would you start a maneuver to a pitch of 230 for this little tweak burn? Over.


CMP
Roger. Pitch 230.


CC
Roger, Mike. And verify track mode in AUTO for the high gain.


CMP
We're in REACQ. Is that all right?


CC
Say again. We need AUTO.

Say again. We're in REACQ - AUTO REACQ.

Oh, Roger, Apollo 11. We got you going to a posigrade attitude and we want you - this burn will be using minus X thrusters at about 2 or 3 feet per second, and we got a load for you. We'll send it up momentarily. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us P00 and ACCEPT? We have a load for you. Over.


CMP
You got it.


CC
Roger, Mike. And our pitch attitude's a little wrong here. If you're ready to copy, I'll give you the SEP PAD. Over.


CMP
Go ahead. Ready to copy.


CC
Roger. Starting with NOUN 33: 130 30 0000, plus 00020, plus all zeros, plus all zeros. Roll all zeros, pitch 230, yaw zero. NOUN 44 is NA. DELTA-VP 00020, burn time 007, DELTA-VC 00020. We have - The rest of the PAD is NA.


CMP
Roger. GET 130 hours 30 minutes, DELTA-VX 2.0, roll zero, pitch 230, yaw zero, DELTA-VC, 2.0.


CC
That's affirmative, Apollo 11. And, Mike, it's similar to the SEP burn prior to flight after the undocking here. And the P41 you should see on register 1 - 2, and then you burn minus X until you read 4. Over.







CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Computer's yours. Over.


CMP
Roger, Charlie. We switched our OMNI D - Delta, and I lost that last transmission. Would you say again, please? The thing I'm wondering about specifically is that earlier you said it would be minus X thrusters and the PAD indicates plus X. Do you want me to null that to zero or do you want to add 2 and leave it as a 4?


CC
Roger, Apollo 11. The way we gave it to you in the attitude we're in, it'll be just like the SEP burn that you had yesterday. You'll see - NOUN 85 will give you a plus 2 and then you just burn minus X until you read 4. Over.


CMP
Understand.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We see you in P41 now. It might take you a couple of minutes to integrate these vectors that we gave you and if you don't make TIG, it's pretty insensitive. You can just let P41 bring you up to TIG, and when you get to zero, you can burn on that. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Okay. Burn complete. Residuals: plus three balls 40, plus four balls 7, plus four balls 2, DELTA-V counter 102.1. Over.


CC
Copy, Apollo 11. Looks good to us. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. How about coming up with a good communications attitude for us to go to between now and the time we maneuver at TEI attitude.


CC
Roger, sir. Stand by.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. A couple of things for you. Over.


CMP
Go ahead.


CC
Okay. Mike, you can maneuver to your preliminary TEI attitude as shown on page 398 of the flight plan, and the high gain angles are good as shown in the flight plan, and we'd like you to dump the waste water at 131 05 down to 10 percent. Over.







CMP
Okay. Understand. I'm going to go to roll 1.1, pitch zero - or 52.6, and yaw 13.8, and you want a waste water dump 10 percent starting at 131 05.

That's affirmative. Right out the LOS.

Apollo 11 under high gain. How do you read?


CC
Five by, 11. How me? Over.


CMP
You're loud and clear, Charlie. What - What numbers are you looking at for TEI TIG preliminary; 135 hours 23 minutes, something like that?


CC
That's affirmative, Mike. We're looking at about nominal time. We've considered kicking it up a REV, but we don't think this REV track is going to be any good since we had the RCS burn and we need some more tracking to get you a good TEI. Over.


CMP
That's what we're looking for.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. Looks like it's going to be pretty relaxed time here for the next couple of hours. We'll have you a PAD, of course, the next REV or so, and we'll keep you posted on TEI. Looks like nominal time. Over.


CMP
Thank you, Charlie.


CC
And your little maneuver back here a moment ago will put you about 20 miles ahead of the LM at TEI.


CMP
Okay.


CMP
Imagine that place has cleared out a little bit after that rendezvous. You can find a place to sit down almost, huh?


CC
Roger. Our MOCR's about empty right now. We're taking it a little easy. How does it feel up there to have some company?







CMP
Damn good, I'll tell you.


CC
I'll bet. I bet, you'd almost be talking to yourself up there after 10 REVS or so.


CMP
No, no. It's a happy home here. It'd be nice to have company. As a matter of fact, it'd be nice to have a couple of hundred million Americans up here.


CC
Roger. Well, they were with you in spirit.


CMP
Let them see what they're getting for their money.


CC
Roger. Well, they were with you in spirit anyway, at least that many. We heard on the news today, 11, that last night - yesterday after you made your landing, New York Times came out with a - headlines, the largest headlines they've ever used in the history of the newspaper.


CMP
Save us a copy.

CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We are standing by. Everything is looking great here. Over.


LMP
Apollo 11. Roger.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you guys want it, we've got some news, here, we can read up. Over.


CDR
Be pleased to have it.


CC
Roger, Neil. Starting off: Congratulatory messages on the Apollo 11 mission have been pouring into the White House from world leaders in a steady stream all day. Among the latest are telegrams from Prime Minister Harold Wilson of Great Britain and the King of Belgium. The world's press has been dominated by news of Apollo 11. Some newsmen estimate that more than 60 percent of the news used in papers across the country today concerned your mission. The New York Times which, as we mentioned before, has had such a demand for its edition of the paper today (even though it ran 950 000 copies) said it will reprint the whole thing on Thursday as a souvenir edition. And Premier Alexei Kosygin has sent congratulations to you and President Nixon through former Vice President Humphrey who is visiting Russia. The cosmonauts have also issued a statement of congratulations. Humphrey quoted Kosygin as saying "I want you to tell the President and the American people that the Soviet Union desires to work with the United States in the cause of peace."


CC
And Mrs. Robert Goddard said today that her husband would have been so happy. "He wouldn't have shouted or anything. He would just have glowed." She added, "That was his dream, sending a rocket to the Moon." People around the world had many reasons to be happy about the Apollo 11 mission. The Italian police reported that Sunday night was the most crime free night of the year. And in London, a boy who had the faith to bet $5 with a bookie that a man would reach the Moon before 1970 collected $24.000. That's pretty good odds.







CC
You're probably interested in the comments your wives have made. Neil, Jan had said about yesterday's activities, "The evening was unbelievably perfect. It is an honor and a privilege to share with my husband, the crew, the Manned Spacecraft Center, the American public, and all mankind; the magnificent experience of the beginning of lunar exploration." She was then asked if she considered the Moon landing the greatest moment in her life. She said "No, that was the day we were married." And Mike, Pat said simply, "It was fantastically marvelous." Buzz, Joan said - apparently couldn't quite believe the EVA on the Moon. She said, "It was hard to think it was real until the men actually moved. After the Moon touchdown, I wept because I was so happy." But she added, "The best part of the mission will be the splashdown."


CC
In other news, and there was a little bit, another explorer: Thor Heyerdahl had to give up his attempt to sail a papyrus boat across the Atlantic. The storm damaged boat was abandoned about 650 miles from Bermuda. The speed of the craft had been reduced to about 25 miles a day, and Heyerdahl said the object of the voyage had not been to provide an endurance test for the crew.


CC
Looking at the world of sports, let's see here. While you were busy the other day, Joe Namath and football Commissioner Pete Rozelle made the announcement that "Broadway Joe" had agreed to sell his interest in the Bachelors III restaurant and report to the New York Jets. Joe arrived at the Jets' training camp today and had his first workout. Several other Jet players who had held out along with Joe also reported. And Davy Hill, from Jackson, Michigan, won his third major golf in as many starts in the past week. He won the Philadelphia Classic. Hill has won four tournaments so far this year and is the leading money winner this year with a cool $129.000. And in baseball, the west division of the National League remains a tight race. LA and San Francisco are one game behind league leading Atlanta. The Astros have a record of 48 wins and 48 losses, and are now in fifth place, seven games out. A twin bill between the Astros and Cincinnati last night was postponed because of rain. The Chicago Cubs







are still in first place in the East Division. They lead the New York Mets by four and one half games. And in the American League, Baltimore is breezing toward the Eastern Division title. They lead second place Boston by 11 games. Looking ahead, the All Star baseball game is scheduled for tomorrow. And President Nixon was scheduled to see the game and then leave immediately after the game for the Pacific splashdown area before going on his tour of Europe. And that about covers the news this day. You guys have been making most of it and I'm sure we couldn't fill you in on any of the details that you don't already know. Out.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've got the load in. You can go back to BLOCK. Over.


CMP
We're there.

Roger.


CMP
Your command module film seems to be working out pretty well, Charlie, the amount we carried. Looks like we carried just about what we needed.


CC
Wonderful.


CMP
We have one 16 millimeter roll on the ASA 1000 color interior film. We were thinking of shooting that during the entry, out window number 4 on a bracket, and you might get the camera guide sometime in the next couple of days and give us all the good settings for that.







CC
Roger.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I wondered if during the TEI burn you utilized the oxidizer flow valve on the PUGS. Over.


LMP
Yes, we did. Based on your very excellent briefing I was expecting the thing to continue desiring increase for the whole time, so we started out with it in INCREASE. I saw that we pretty quickly crossed the line and started falling about 6 or 7 percent behind, so I was still expecting it to move up, and then I went down to FULL DECREASE and brought it back down to a difference of 2 percent. Over.


CC
Roger. Thank you very much, Buzz.


LMP
Two tenths of a percent, I'm sorry.


CC
Roger. Thank you.

CMP
Roger. Understand.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, did you notice any transients at ignition on TEI? Over.


CMP
Yes. The transients were more noticeable than on the previous burns, Charlie. I just wrote it off on the fact we had a light command module, but there was considerable roll activity which dampened down after the first 20 seconds, I would guess, of the burn; but then there was also some pitch and yaw activity. I don't believe it was abnormal, and it seemed to be deadbanding ratherly crisply in roll plus or minus about 8 degrees either side of the center line; and after the







first couple of - oh, after the first 20 seconds or so, the gimbals were quiet, and pitch and yaw were relatively quiet. Before that, there was some oscillation but mostly just in rates. Total attitude hung in there pretty well.


CC
Roger. Thank you much. We were looking at the playback, and we saw some things that - right at start up. We'll be back with you later on that.

Roger, 11. This is the regional CAP COMM. Congratulations on an outstanding job. You guys have really put on a great show up there. I think it's about time you powered down and got a little rest, however. You've had a mighty long day here. Hope you're all going to get a good sleep on the way back. I look forward to seeing you when you get back here. Don't fraternize with any of those bugs in route except for the Hornet.

Roger. Copy. Also, did you notice - was there any indication of any dust cloud as you lifted off? Over.







CDR
Not very much. There was quite a bit of Kapton and parts of the LM that went out in all directions, usually for great distances, as far as I can tell. But I don't remember seeing anything of a dust cloud to speak of.


CC
Roger. Understand all you could see was parts of the LM going out. What was your - your first - first comment? Over.

Roger, Charlie. Like to bring you up to date on our chlorination status. In compartment B4, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven - correction, we have eight pockets for chlorine and buffer ampules, of which - Let me correct that. We have seven pockets, of which one is empty and always has been empty, leaving six remaining. On the other side over there in B7, we have another container with seven pockets, so we have a total of seven plus six, and those are filled with six chlorines and seven buffers. Now, I've been using one chlorine and one buffer per day which, at this point in time, prior to







this chlorination I'm about to do, leaves me one chlorine and two buffers. Seems to me I'm one chlorine short, and that being the case, I'd like to ask your advice on postponing this chlorination using the last container until some later date, like maybe tomorrow. Over.

LMP
Houston, we're ready to copy.


CC
Roger. At about 148 hours, if you've not already done so, a CO2 filter change, and the H2 purge line heater on 20 minutes before the O2 and H2 purge. At 148 hours, we'd like you to initiate a charge on battery Alfa instead of at 151 hours, and leave the charge on until we notify you further. At 150 hours GET, waste water dump to 10 percent. We do plan to burn midcourse correction 5. It will be an RCS burn about 5 feet per second at about the nominal time in the flight plan. Over.

LMP
Roger. We're all listening. Go ahead.


CC
Roger. From the hot wires of the Public Affairs Office: Apollo 11 still dominates the news around the world. Only four nations, Communist China, North Korea, North Viet Nam, and Albania, have not yet informed their citizens of your flight and landing on the Moon. One newsman said that he has run out of ways to describe your success. Tonight, President Nixon is scheduled to watch the All Star baseball game in Washington. After the game, he will depart for the Pacific recovery area. Wednesday evening, he will fly from Johnston Island by helicopter to the Navy communications ship Arlington. Then on Thursday morning, he will reboard the helicopter and fly to the Hornet in time to witness your splashdown. Accompanying the President will be Secretary of State William Rogers and Frank Borman. They will watch the splashdown from the bridge of the recovery ship with Admiral John Sidney McCain, Jr., Commander of the Pacific Forces. Following the President's stay aboard the Hornet, he will depart for his tour of Asia and scheduled visit to Romania. Luna 15 is believed to have crashed into the Sea of Crises yesterday after orbiting the Moon 52 times. The Soviet News Agency TASS reported that "scientific"







"research in near Moon space was carried out." Sir Bernard Lovell at Jodrell Bank Observatory said that Luna 15 hit the surface of the Moon at a speed of about 300 miles per hour. Things have been relatively quiet recently in Viet Nam. GI's on patrol were observed carrying transistor radios tuned into your flight. The Armed Forces radio and TV network in Viet Nam gave the mission full coverage. Skirmishes still continue between the Egyptians and Israelis along the Suez Canal. U.N. observers there are trying to halt the action. In Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee has voted to reduce the 27.5 percent oil depletion allowance to 20 percent. We've had rain several times here in the Houston area. Today it is cloudy, and more showers are expected. On the sports front, as we mentioned earlier, the All Star game is tonight. There were no games played yesterday. Last night in New York, the Baseball Writers Association of America named Babe Ruth the greatest ball player of all time. Joe DiMaggio was named the greatest living ball player. Frank Borman made the announcements at a dinner honoring the players. Joe Namath put in a full day at the New York Jets' training camp. Five policemen had a hard time restraining about 500 kids who wanted to touch Broadway Joe. He said he feels fine and will play in the All Star game August 1, if Coach Weeb Eubank lets him. The Oilers' camp at Kerrville got wet yesterday, but the workouts continued. There have been some minor injuries, but nothing too serious. Coach Wally Lemm is satisfied so far with the workouts. The Oilers are expecting attendance by over 30.000 for the preseason game with Buffalo. Apparently, Don Meredith's announced retirement isn't expected to dampen enthusiasm, especially around here in Houston. Mario Andretti won the 200 mile Trenton Auto Race Sunday and is now the leading race driver in the U.S. Auto Club's point standings. And that's about the summary of the morning news this afternoon in Houston. Over.


LMP
Look up the Dow Jones Industrials for us.

Apollo 11, we've completed the uplink. The computer's yours.


CMP
Thank you.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


LMP
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. With respect to the Dow Jones industrials, since closing on Tuesday afternoon the 15th up to about 1:05 p.m. Houston time this afternoon, why, the effect has been a net drop; that is, minus 6 points on the industrial average. So far today since opening, the Dow Jones industrial average has gone down by 11.05 after rising 1 1/2 shortly after opening. Today's performance on the utilities is a drop of 1.63, and railroads a drop of 1.58. Over.


CMP
Every flight has to have some disadvantages, I guess.


CC
Roger. There is some speculation that you all are responsible for that 1 1/2 point rise right after opening.


CMP
Well, don't blame the 11 point drop on us, anyway.


CC
Roger.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you have a minute or so free, I wonder if we could get Mike to give us a little bit of clarification on what happened around about the time of docking. We copied him as mentioning that contact was very smooth, almost imperceptible; and we're a little bit inquisitive or curious about his remarks as to what happened after probe retraction. Over.


CMP
Roger. I docked in CMC AUTO, and as I said, I wasn't really sure of the moment of contact. I kept cross checking the docking probe indicators. I got two barber poles indicating that the three capture latches - not capture latches, but the three ... latches had made, and we were soft







docked. And at that time the situation looked very stable. So, I went to CMC FREE, glanced back out the window and it still looked stable; and I fired primary 2 bottle. And at that time, a gyration began between the two vehicles due I'm not sure to what. Perhaps the LM thrusting or perhaps it was building up prior, and I hadn't noticed it. But anyway, during the RETRACT of the probe, there were yaw - my yaw excursions of, I would guess, around 15 degrees, and I had to come back on, take the FREE switch and throw it back to AUTO, and try to damp them out; and I guess Neil was doing the same in the LM. I'll let him tell you about his side of it. And I though that we were not going to get a successful RETRACT and hard dock. However, in about - oh, I guess 6 or 8 seconds, I did hear - could see the situation damping out, and then we heard the noise indicating the docking latches had fired; and later on when I got into the tunnel, all 12 of them had properly engaged.


CC
Roger.


CDR
And on the LM side, we were in AGS MIN deadband ATT HOLD; and at contact, I thrusted plus X; and shortly after that we had a sizable attitude oscillation and thruster firing, so we opened up the deadband to MAX and manually flew the vehicle into stable attitude during the retraction. It went to OFF after ...


CC
Roger. Thank you very much. Out.

Roger. If Neil has a free minute, we've got a question or two regarding the CO2 partial pressure and water in the suit loop discrepancies noted yesterday. Over.


CDR
Go ahead.


CC
Roger, 11. Was water noted in both suits or only in yours, Neil?


CDR
I think only in my suit.


CC
Okay. Can you locate that occurrence for us in time when you first noticed water in the suit, either by mission time or relation to any particular event?


CDR
I think it was after insertion sometime, Bruce. I don't remember exactly when. I - It was when we were in orbit and had our - after we took our helmets off.


CC
Roger. Did you call it to us when you first noticed it, or was it sometime after when you called it?


CDR
I'd guess it might have been probably 20 minutes after I noticed it that I mentioned it to you.


CC
Roger. Was this noticing the water accompanied by erratic CO2 partial pressure readings, or was that a separate problem? Over.







CDR
Well, the water problem evidenced itself before we noted any erratic motions of the PC02 gage.


CC
Roger. And what was the relative sequence on selecting water separator number 2 and the secondary CO2 canister; that is, did you go to the secondary water separator first and then the secondary CO2? Over.


LMP
I believe we went to secondary CO2 first.


CDR
Secondary hydroxide - lithium hydroxide.


CC
Roger. We copy. And was there any change in your suit loop - -


CDR
No.


CC
Go ahead.


LMP
I should mention, Bruce, that when I went to water secondary - water separator to secondary there, I didn't notice any change. But about after 15 minutes or 20 minutes, the water stopped coming out. So maybe that was just water that was already in the loop that was still blowing out, but the secondary water separator was operating properly.


CC
Roger. Did you make any changes in the suit loop configuration after you went from the egress mode to the cabin mode after insertion; that is, in particular, they're interested in knowing if you recall changing the diverter valve position to EGRESS at any time while you were on the secondary canister? Over.


CMP
No. I don't believe we did that at all, Bruce.


CC
Okay, 11. Thank you. That sums up our questions for now, and we'll crank these back into the engineering pipeline and see what we can come up with.


LMP
Okay. Are you satisfied that the CO2 circuit breaker was in on jettison? Over.


CC
Say again, please?







LMP
Roger. On LM jettison, are you satisfied that the CO2 circuit breaker was in? Over.


CC
Yes. It was in.


LMP
Roger. Could you confirm that? I thought there was some question after we got into the command module as to whether that had been left in or not. Over.


CC
Roger, 11. It was in and confirmed in, and the readings after jettison stayed about 0.1 to 0.2.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We have not noticed any change in the signal coming through on the LMP's EKG. When he has a little free time, we'd like him to check into it again. Over.


LMP
Roger. I looked at all three of the upper chest center ones, and they appear to be fairly tight. I'll push them back in again. Over.


CC
Roger. On the TM here, we noticed some fluctuations that may have been attributed to your moving the sensors around or pushing on them, but the erratic problem seems to be persisting.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.


CC
11, this is Houston. Over.


LMP
Roger. I wonder if you've noticed any change in the BIOMED returns you're getting. Over.

Negative, Buzz. It still looks kind of bad. Apparently, when you move around, it's cutting in and out. Have you checked the little electrical connector where it goes into the signal conditioner? Over.


LMP
Yes. They're all about as tight as can be. I tell you what; I'll take them off and put them back on again and see if that makes any difference.

Thank you, Bruce. You've got about a minute and 20 seconds.


CC
Roger. We concur.


CMP
Houston, do you copy our residuals?


CC
Roger. We've got your residual fuel counter reading for us.


CMP
DELTA-VC is plus 0.2.


CC
Roger. Plus 0.2.


CMP
That was actually plus 100.2. Okay?


CC
Okay.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Go ahead, 11.


CMP
Roger. We're in PTC attitude and would you please give us a call when our thruster activity has subsided sufficiently?


CC
Roger. Stand by.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're going to hand over from Madrid to Goldstone at 151 hours even.







If you should lose lock on the high gain at this time, you may reaequire at pitch minus 45, yaw 270. Break. We're still watching your rates. Over.


CDR
Okay. Thank you.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


CDR
This is 11, Houston.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


CDR
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
11, we're still seeing rates on your spacecraft above those we would like for the continuation of the PTC mode which we are still monitoring, and we'll advise you when it has settled down. Over.


CDR
Okay.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are go for the spinup on PTC. Over.


CDR
Thank you.


CDR
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.


CC
Go ahead, 11.


CDR
Roger. It didn't like it that time. When I got down to the entry 27303 ENTER, it took off in roll at a high rate in excess of 1 degree per second. Over. I've stopped it now, and we are going to have to go back and do it over again. I'd like to try to find out the reason it did that.


CC
Roger. You might as well start setting up for it, and we will be working the problem here.


CDR
Okay. Do you have us on high bit rate here now?


CC
That's affirmative.


CDR
Okay, good. I'll maneuver back to PTC initiation attitude while you guys look at the data and see what you think.


CC
Roger.







CDR
Houston, Apollo 11. I think the reason is in having 1620 on the DSKY during the subsequent entries, or at least that's one possibility.


CC
Roger. We'll check it out.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. While you're waiting for the CSM to settle down and for us to look at the tapes on your latest maneuver, would you feel like answering some more questions with relation to the lunar surface? Over.


CDR
Go ahead.


CDR
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Roger. For 64 thousand dollars, we're still trying to work out the location of your landing site, Tranquility Base. We think it is located on LAM 2 chart at Juliet 0.5 and 7.8. Do you still have those charts on board? Over.


CDR
Yes. Stand by one. They're packed.


CC
Roger. You may not have to unpack it. The position which I just gave you is slightly west of West Crater. I guess it's about two tenths of a kilometer west of it, and we were wondering if Neil or Buzz had observed any additional landmarks during descent, lunar stay, or ascent which would confirm or disprove this. One thing that we're wondering about is that if you were at this position, you would have seen the Cat's Paw during ascent just up to the north of your track. Over.


CDR
We were looking for the Cat's Paw, too, thinking we were probably downrange, beyond the Big V. But I think that it's likely that that might have been West Crater that we went across in landing, but - Stand by.


CDR
We're hoping, Bruce, that our 16 mm film was working at that point in descent, and we'll be able to confirm our touchdown position. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters, and crater rows, and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't been able to yet.







CC
Roger. And the next question from our panel is for Buzz. We recall that he reported seeing a laser upon AOS of the Earth the first time after - the first REV after ascent, and we're wondering what color the beam was and if he could determine at the approximate location with respect to the Earth. Over.


LMP
It was mostly white, perhaps a tinge of yellowish color to it; and it seemed to be - as I recall it, the terminator of the Earth was toward the horizon and seemed to be about a quarter to a third of the way down from - down towards the terminator of the Earth - from the opposite horizon. That's a third to a quarter Earth radii. Over.


CC
Roger. And that puts it in the light side? Over.


LMP
Roger. Yes, it was in the light side. The Earth was about - a two thirds lit Earth, with the terminator down toward the horizon. And now coming from the opposite limb of the Earth, the sunlight limb, coming down about one quarter to one third of a radius in from the limb. Generally, pensively located with respect to a line drawn perpendicular to the terminator that goes through the center. Over.


CC
Roger, Buzz. We copy.


LMP
And I got pictures of that. I'm sure that will show up.


CDR
And I saw that, too. It was a very bright spot of light and I confirm Buzz's observation of its position.


CC
Okay, 11. Very good. Now, with respect to the documented sample container: on television it appeared to us as though the samples for that container were in fact being given - being selected in accordance with some thought or consideration being given to the rocks themselves. And we were wondering if you could give any further details from memory about any of these samples, and the context of the material or the surface from which they were taken. Over.







CDR
Yes. You remember I initially started on the cut side of the LM that the TV camera was on, and I took a number of samples of rocks on the surface, and several that were just subsurface - about 20 - 15 to 20 feet north of the LM. And then I recalled that that area had been probably swept pretty well by the exhaust of the descent engine, so I crossed over to the southern side of the LM, and took a number of samples from the area around the elongate double crater that we commented on, and several beyond that, and tried to take as many different types - of rock types as I could see by eye - as I could in the short time we had available. There were a number of other samples that I had seen earlier in our stroll around the LM that I had hoped to get back and pick up and put in the documented sample, but I didn't get those, and I'll be able to comment in detail when we get in the debriefing session.


CC
Roger. Did you observe any small craters with conspicuously blocky rims? Over.


CDR
Well, aside from the one big one that we went over, I guess there were none in our area. I took a stroll back after putting up the EASEP, and while Buzz was starting to unpack the documented samples - took a stroll back to a crater behind us that was maybe 70 or 80 feet in diameter and 15 or 20 feet deep, and took some pictures of it. It had rocks in the bottom of pretty good size, considerably bigger than any that were out on the surface, but there was no - we apparently, at 15 feet or so, had not gotten below the regolith. We were essentially showing no bedrock, at least in the walls of the crater at that depth. Over.


CC Roger. We copy,


CC
Okay. Thank you, Neil. That about wraps up the questions we have on hand for now.


CDR
Okay.


CDR
My compliments to the chef. The food is outstanding. This cream of chicken soup I give at least three spoons.







CC
Okay. Cream of chicken, three spoons.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.

Go ahead.


CC
11, we concur that having VERB 16, NOUN 20 up on the DSKY may well have had some effect on your PTC initiation. It looks like this would give - let the computer work with a knowledge of the actual CDU angles. What we'd like you to do is do a CDU zero which is VERB 40, NOUN 20, ENTER, and then start the PTC procedure again at step 2 with loading VERB 6, NOUN 22, desired attitude in the AUTO maneuver, and all that. Over.

Okay. The only thing I don't understand about that is why it took off at the rate it did. What rate should it have taken off at under that theory?

Stand by a minute, Mike.

11, CMP, this is Houston. Over.


CMP
Go ahead, Houston.


CC
Mike, over here on page 9 7 of your checklist where we're setting up PTC, there's been a note penciled in after, "Wait 20 minutes for rate to damp. Do not monitor VERB 16, NOUN 20." It turns out that the significance of that is that, if you are monitoring 16 NOUN 20, then when you get down here in step 7, the second time you do a VERB 24, you've got to reload the NOUN 01 to make it VERB 24, NOUN 01, ENTER, before you load the three registers. Over.

CC
11, Houston. The radios are still in good shape, and we are still waiting for your rates to decay. We've got 0.03 degrees per second in pitch now.


 CMP
Okay. We're - we're in no rush. This is a very pleasant attitude, as a matter of fact. The Sun is down in the LEB, so it's not shining through the windows and heating the place up.

We can do it either way. I had planned the positive.

A 50 degree roll attitude will probably give us that, Joe.

That's a good one because it puts the Earth out window 1 and the Moon out window 3 and puts the Sun down in the LEB, so the lighting in here remains relatively constant.

CDR
We know there's a lot of scientists from a number of countries standing by to see the lunar samples, and we thought you'd be interested to see them as they really are here. These two boxes are the sample return containers. They - They're vacuum packed containers that were closed in a vacuum on the lunar surface, sealed, and then brought inside the LM and put inside these fiber glass bags, zippered, and resealed around the outside, and placed in these receptacles in the side of the command module. These are the two boxes. And as soon as we get onto the ship,







I'm sure these boxes will immediately be transferred and delivery started to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. These boxes include the samples of the various types of rock, the groundmass of the soil, the sand and silt, and the particle collector for the solar wind experiment, and the core tubes that took depth samples of the lunar surface.

CC
Roger. You're very clear when you come through. It's just that your VOX is not keying at every word. Over.


LMP
Okay. These bite sized objects were designed to remove the problem of having so many crumbs floating around in the cabin, so they designed a particular size that would be able to go to the mouth all at once. I think since all of our experience, we've discovered that we could progress a good bit further than that back some of the type meals that we have on Earth. As a matter of fact, on this flight we've carried along pieces of bread, and along with the bread we have a ham spread; and I'll show you, I hope, how easy it is to spread some ham while I'm in zero g.

Apollo 11, Houston. We notice your roll rate increasing. Will you please see if you can bring that down to about 04 or we'll be losing high gain shortly. Over.


LMP
You can also use zero gravity to demonstrate many things that we've all learned in school. I'd like to demonstrate briefly how easy it is to explain the action of the gyroscope. If I spin this can, we know that according to the equations of motion that we would expect that once this is given a spin, and has a spin axis in this direction, if we give it a particular torque, and I'll do this by pushing my hands against it in this fashion once it's spinning. By the equations we can predict that, as I put this torque on it, it will in fact rotate this direction. Let's see how well this works out.


*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.







LMP
See that as I apply the torque this way, it's rotated this way.


CMP
Too close, I think.


CC
11, Houston. It's a pretty good demonstration.


CMP
Houston, this next is a little demonstration for the kids at home, all kids everywhere, for that matter. I was going to show you how you drink water out of a spoon, but I'm afraid I filled the spoon too full and if I'm not careful, I'm going to spill water right over the sides. Can you see the water slopping around on the top of the spoon, kids?


CC
That's affirmative, 11.


CMP
Okay. Well, as I said, I was going to show you but I'm afraid I filled it too full and it's going to spill over the sides. I'll tell you what. I'll just turn this one over and get rid of the water and start all over again. Okay?


CC
Okay.


CMP
And you can see, up here we don't know where over is. One up is as good as another. That really is water, though. I'll show you.


CMP
That's really not the way we drink. We really have a water gun which I'll show you.


CMP
Here's the water gun. This cylindrical thing on the end of it is a filter with several membranes: one allows water to pass, but not any gas; the other allows gas to pass, but not any water. So, by routing the gaseous water which comes from our tank through this filter, we're enabled to drink purified water without the gas in it, filtered water. And, of course, all we do to - to get it started is just pull the trigger.


CMP
It's sort of messy. I haven't been at this very long. It's sort of the same system that the Spaniards used to drink out of wineskins at bull fights, only I think this is even more fun. Well, be seeing you, kids.







CC
Thank you from all us kids in the world, here in the MOCR, who can't tell the Earth from the Moon.

It just so happens that's what we were talking about now. There is a little bit of dampness around the outside edge of the hatch, but a very, very slight amount. We've got a hose up there that we're hoping will sort of help keep it a little bit dry.







CC
Roger, Mike. Thank you much. Have you seen any more water collecting on the aft bulkhead? Over.

How's the weather down there? You got any rain?


CC
Roger. We've been having a little bit, thunderstorm type, the last couple of days. We had a pretty good rain today, smd it's been overcast. A slow storm system's been moving through the area in the last couple of days, and primarily evening and afternoon thundershowers.


CMP
Roger. We were watching a few clouds in your area through the monocular along the Texas Gulf Coast this afternoon, and we also noticed there were clouds over Baja California, which is a little bit unusual.

Roger. Thank you for the weather report. We can't quite see that far. It seems to have







cleared up outside now, according to some of the people coming in. This constant overcast in the MOCR here is a little hard to see outside.

Stand by Buzz. It looks pretty good as far as I could tell. We got the - along the tropical convergence line there, there's a few clouds shown on the weather map I'm looking at here, but nothing of significance. Right now - Stand by. Let's see, right now in the mid - yes, at the MPL - we've got 3000 scattered, visibility 10, waves height 3 feet, is the present weather. I don't think there's anything forecast to be of significance. There are a couple of - FLIGHT just informed me that what I just gave you was the forecast.







are a couple of tropical storms in the - well, not in the area of landing but in the Pacific. A storm called Claudia which is north - correction - about east of Hawaii. It's going northwest and dissipating. And there's one called Viola, which is out over Guam, and so they aren't any factor at all. It looks like it's going to be real nice for recovery.


CC
Navy called up those special calm seas for you guys from up there on the Hudson.


LMP
Well, we might need it. We'll get a look at it tomorrow, I guess, though. We'll probably be giving it a pretty close eye.


CC
Roger.


CC
11, Houston. The RETRO's were wondering if you could fill us in on any non nominal stowage that we have on board. Just location and weight is about all they're interested in. Over.

And, Apollo 11, Houston. Would you please place O2 tank 1 heater to AUTO? Over.


CMP
AUTO it is.


CDR
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Go ahead.


CDR
What we'll do Charlie, tomorrow, is go through and reconfigure our stowage as closely as possible to nominal. Some things that will not be nominal are as follows: the EVA visors were brought back into the command module, and we have not yet found a home for them. We'll let you know where they go. In addition, there's about 5 pounds of miscellaneous weight from the LM







in compartment Able 8, and it's taking the place of the LCG's which we moved from A 8 into the suit bag. We got rid of one miscellaneous trash bag, mostly old food wrapping and also old underwear and that helmet protective visor of the CMP's. We left all that with Eagle. And those are about the only off nominals we have.


CC
Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Out.


CDR
Roger.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We got the rates looking copacetic. You can go ahead and initiate PTC. Over.


CMP
Okay. Thank you.


CC
And Buzz, we're still not getting any data from your EKG. It looks like the only way that we're going to be able to get any is if, at your convenience, you would take your - change out your EKG leads, which are the center ones that are connected to the blue pin; and there's a spare one in the medical box. Over.


LMP
Roger. How many did you want me to change?


CC
Just the center one. I'll get the right nomenclature from the Doc. Stand by. It's called the sternal EKG, which are the three center ones, and it's got - they lead into a - into the blue stringed lead ones. Over.

APOLLO 11 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION




LMP
Okay. There's three of them, is that right?


CC
That's affirmative.


LMP
And you want me to change all three.


CC
That's affirmative and they're all hooked together from the picture I'm looking at, and they go into the center belt, signal conditioner, and it's got the blue strain relief on it.


LMP
Yes. I checked the connectors at both ends on that. I don't guess we have a spare signal conditioner or anything like that, do we?


CC
No. We do not.


LMP
Well, I can show you my heart's still working.


CC
We believe it.


CDR
Charlie, what we suggest here is, before we start that, turn our two suit powers off and plug his blue lead into my blue signal conditioner and see if we can get his signal through my signal conditioner. Okay?


CC
Roger. That's a good suggestion, Neil. We concur. Over.


LMP
Okay, Charlie. We're transmitting, and let's see if you get any EKG signal on the CDR at this point.


CC
Roger. Stand by.


CC
11, Houston. We get some data, but it's got the same problem that we had through Buzz's signal conditioner, so apparently the lead is broken and we'd like you to change it out if you could. Over.


LMP
Okay.


CC
Thank you.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Go ahead, sir.







LMP
Roger. I think the problem was that the center lead had dried out. ... put the new one on, and I'll see how that works. Over.


CC
Roger.


LMP
I can't tell you how good it feels to get it off.


CC
Yes. I can imagine.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Go ahead, 11. Over.


LMP
Roger. How do you read my EKG now?


CC
Stand by. We'll let the docs look at it. Buzz, we're on low bit rate. We'll get you on a high gain momentarily, and we'll let you know then. Over.


LMP
Okay. I got my high gain antenna coming out.


CC
Roger. Just leave on REACQ. We'll get you.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz, your EKG looks good now. The doc said thanks a lot.


LMP
Okay. They're welcome.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Based on our sighting since the midcourse, we're showing a gamma of minus 6.57. This is preliminary, though, and we think that after some more tracking it should come on in, and we could tweak it right on into the corridor. It's just about in the center of the corridor; everything's looking fine. We'll have you an entry PAD in a couple of hours before you go to sleep. And from our friends in public affairs, a few headlines, other than your flight. You're still dominating the news. However, there are some other things of interest for you. As I mentioned earlier, the All Star game was rained out. It's going to be played tomorrow. However, President Nixon will not be able to see it as he planned. We'll keep you posted on results. And, also, the weathermen are going to be good to you. Our forecast is, looks like it's holding good for the recovery area; it should be real fine out there. President Nixon, as he prepares to fly out to greet







your return, predicted that within 31 years man will have visited at least one other planet bearing some form of life. "In the year 2000, we, on this Earth, will have visited new worlds where there will be a form of life," he told 2000 foreign exchange students at the White House. Before he left for his week long trip, the President sent Congress his proposal for organizing - reorganizing the Interstate Commerce Commission. He also conferred with chairman Earl Wheeler of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on his return from Viet Nam, and the launch of Intelstat was scrubbed and has been rescheduled for 10 p.m., eastern daylight time on Wednesday. The second stage fuel ground support system showed some contamination.


CC
And back in Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to tax changes affecting oil companies, banks, and utilities that could add nearly 2 billion a year to federal revenue. And, also today, NASA announced it will launch a large orbital workshop in 1972, with a cutdown version of the Saturn V. And, your television pictures attracted a lot of interest. They were shown live throughout just about the whole world, and, we're expecting hundreds of telephone calls from mothers all over the world complaining that their youngsters are trying to drink milk from spoons, thanks to you, Mike.


CMP
I take it all back.


CC
You need more practice.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Buzz, you brought the surgeon right out of his chair. We see you exercising. Over.

We see you exercising. Is that correct, Buzz?

Roger. We sure did. We're wondering who selected - made your selections?


CDR
That's an old favorite of mine, about - It's an album made about 20 years ago, called "Music Out of the Moon."

It's supposed to sound that way.

CMP
Oh, good. Glad to hear it.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. I was just reading some of the transcripts of earlier today about this earlier PTC that we attempted, and when you keyed into VERB 24 and did the two ENTER's, it took off on you. I think we got a story on that, if you'd like to listen to why it had such a high rate, Mike. Over.


CMP
Yes. I'm all ears.


CC
Okay. I think it would be better if you got your checklist out on 97, and we could walk you through it, and that way I could probably get the story straight. Over.


CMP
Okay. I got it.


CC
Okay. Mike, what happened is - you know, you were sitting there monitoring VERB 16, NOUN 20, and at step 7 you went into VERB 24, NOUN 01, and keyed in the address and then INFORMATION INFORMATION; and on the final ENTER of that 35400 ENTER, right after that, it - that then put you back into the 16, NOUN 20. Then when you did the VERB 24, ENTER, you were really entering the information in the actual CDU; and when you got the two entries in, in register 1 and 2, it was an - it was an instantaneous change in the actual CDU, and the CM DAP looked at that and saw - saw what it thought it







had. My - my gosh, I got a 600 degree per second rate. And it turns on the jets to try to take that rate out. And the rate filters that it's looking at - it - well, the rate it's looking at is filtered, so it doesn't really sense the actual rate until the thing is already built up, and then it starts reading the rate filters, and it says, "Well, I really didn't have 600 degrees." So then it turns it off and tries to slow it down. But until that happens, and it is some time lag, and that's why the rate was building up. The jets were on, and they were going to stay on due to that instantaneous 600 - suspected 600 degree per second rate. Over.


CMP
Okay. I got you.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Man.


LMP
Hey, Charlie, are you saying that for a short period of time, he actually loaded NOUN 20 with some value other than was being read by the CDU?


CC
I think I got that, Buzz. That's affirmative. But when he did that second VERB 24, you were - the NOUN was 20, so when he did the 3175 and then a 002 ENTER, what he actually did there was load the first two actual CDU locations, and the computer looked at it - the DAP looked at it as an instantaneous change in the actual CDU. Stand by on your comments. We're switching antennas.


LMP
Roger.


CC
- - We're very scratchy.


LMP
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. We got you back now on the high gain. Did you copy all that, Buzz? Over.


LMP
Yes. I think so. I - I thought maybe that NOUN 20 was one of those that you could never load from the DSKY, and that still maybe. Maybe it was loaded just for the short period of time, and then when the counters read the - the gimbal angles, why they changed it back to what they actually are. But in the meantime, the DAP saw this different number. Is that right?







CC
Well, our guidance guy was telling me that you can actually load those ACDU's, the actual CDU's, but we'll - we're checking on that. Over.


LMP
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. Buzz, the word from the back room is that you can actually load the NOUN 20, but you should not.


LMP
Yes. I got that. Thank you.


CC
You're welcome.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We got a recommendation for you on your stowage of the EVVA's. Over.


LMP
Go ahead.

Okay. We'd like - the SPAN guys say it looks - they think that one would go on the helmet that you're going to have in B1, and you could put the other one on Mike's helmet, which will be in the sleep restraint. Over.


CDR
I doubt if it will fit on the helmet in B1. The other one might - might go in the sleep restraint. We've got them in our helmet bags, and I guess we're going to have to keep the helmets in the helmet bags, and the LEVVA's in the LEVVA bags.


CC
Roger.


CDR
Yes. I've been thinking maybe they ought to stay sealed up.


CC
Okay. We - -


CMP
It won't hack B1, Charlie, with the cover. I tried it already.


CC
Okay. Fine. We weren't sure of that. It was just a suggestion. We thought we'd - You check it out. Sounds like you've already done that, so I guess whatever you can come up with, just let us know.

to do it on our marks from the ground. The PTC is a little bit ragged, and we would like to make the water dump at a time which we think will hold it in its proper configuration, so it looks like we'll have a desirable opportunity coming along in - between 15 and 20 minutes. And on our mark, we would like to have a waste water dunp down to about 40 percent. I'll give you a more accurate level for the water dump a little later. Over.

Apollo 11, Houston. I'm not certain you copied my last transmission, as we were just in the process of switching OMNI's. We'd like to advance the time on that water dump until about 5 minutes from now. And we'll give you a precise mark on the time to start the dump, and we are standing by for a readout on your CM RCS ejector temperatures. Over.

Roger, 11. We concur.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. I can read up your forecast weather for the recovery any time you'd like to hear about it. Over.


LMP
Go ahead.







CC
11, Houston. Present forecast shows acceptable conditions in your recovery area: 2000 foot scattered, high scattered, wind from 070 degrees, 13 knots, visibility 10 miles, and sea state about 4 feet. The forecast yesterday showed a tropical storm, Claudia, some 500 to 1000 miles east of Hawaii. The - the pictures from Earth satellites taken yesterday afternoon - afternoon showed Claudia dissipating, so this appears to be even less a factor than it was before. Your recovery area is now believed to be just a little ways north of the intertropical convergence zone, which you can probably see when you look out your windows there. Yesterday there was also a report of a tropical storm, Viola, further to the west. Its present location is some thousand miles east of the Phillipines and moving northwest. Tropical storm Viola has been intensifying, and should be transferred to the typhoon category within the next 12 hours or so; however, that will be far to your west. As a matter of fact, sunrise terminator has not yet reached Viola. When it does several hours from now, you can probably distinguish it from your viewpoint quite readily. As a matter of fact it should be of interest to perhaps take some pictures. Comment on it when you get a chance to see Viola in a few hours. So that's about the present weather state and situation for your recovery area. Over.

That sounds pretty good ...

CC
That looks real good, Mike. Looks like we picked up about 30 dB on the signal strength.


CMP
Yes. It came in quite quickly. However, I'm showing about 240 yaw and about zero on pitch, now.


CC
Roger. About 240 and 0.

APOLLO 11 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION




CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.


CDR
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. Just wanted to make sure you fellows hadn't gone back to sleep again. And I also have a little bit of late news here if you'd like to find out what's happened in the last 12 - 14 hours. Over.


CDR
Okay. Go ahead.


CC
Okey doke. Hot off the press here: We find Juan Carlos was formally designated yesterday - Tuesday - to become General Franco's successor - as the Chief of State of Spain and eventual King. Juan Carlos will be sworn in today as his successor designate after taking an oath of loyalty to the law and the National Movement, Spain's only legal political organization. He will apparently be called the Prince of Spain.


CC
House Ways and Means Committee also has agreed yesterday to tax changes affecting oil companies, also banks and utilities, which could add as much as 2 billion dollars per year to the federal revenue. The committee also voted tentatively to change the accounting procedures for telephone, electric, gas, and oil pipeline companies and to reduce tax benefits of mutual savings and loan institutions. So, it looks as if tax reform may be on the way.


CC
Looking overseas, we find South Korea's first super highway, linking Seoul with the Port of Inchon, has been named the Apollo Highway to commemorate your trip. I think we mentioned last night that President Nixon has already started on his round the world trip, and today he is in San Francisco on his first stop which will take him to the U.S.S. Hornet, from which he'll watch the return of your spacecraft. He plans to visit seven nations including Rumania during this trip. He, as I think you also knew, had to miss the All Star baseball game yesterday, as it was rained out; but it is being played today.







CC
The West Coast residents in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Vancouver, British Columbia; and San Francisco all plan to make their areas visible to the three of you by lighting their lights between 9 pm and midnight tonight, according to the Associated Press. We do have clear weather predicted there, so you may be able to see Christmas lights, porch lights, store lights, and whatever may be turned on.


CDR
Good show.


CC
A little closer to home here, back in Memphis, Tennessee, a young lady who is presently tipping the scales at 8 pounds, 2 ounces, was named "Module" by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Eddie Lee McGhee. "It wasn't my idea." said Mrs. McGhee, "It was my husband's." She said she had balked at the name Lunar Module McGhee, because it didn't sound too good, but apparently they have compromised on just Module. Over.


SC
(Laughter) ...


CC
Roger. Hear a few chuckles coming from that direction. And we do have a late report on the sports here also. The All Star game currently being played. The present score at the end of the fourth inning has the National League leading the American League by 9 to 3. So the hitters are having a good day, you can tell.


CC
And rain clouds are over the MSC area at the moment. It began raining here just about 10 minutes ago, and last report, we were having a pretty heavy deluge. So, that's it from the news front for the afternoon here, Apollo 11. Over.


CDR
Thank you very much, Owen. I think my yard could use some water.


CC
That's very true. I've forgotten exactly how many days it did go, Buzz, but something like 30 days without rain; and we can aprreciate the rain we're getting right now.







LMP
That was Neil. This is Buzz, here. I wish we could find out when the last time my lawn was cut. Over.


CMP
That might be a little more difficult to find out. I'm not sure whether the - whether Mike is ready to admit when he last did the job, but I'll look into that for you.


LMP
Well, he'll tell you. He's got a new mower.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Hey, ask my chinch bugs how they're toing?


CC
Well, I'm not sure about your's. I can let you know about my own, and the report isn't very good.


CC
11, Houston. Over.


LMP
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. Joan wasn't home right now, Buzz, but Janis reports the grass is getting pretty high, and I would estimate that it's going to be close to your knees by the time you get out of quarantine. Over.


LMP
Okay. I'll have to schedule a little discussion after I get back.


CC
Roger. And no reports - no report from the chinch bugs there, Mike.


CMP
Well, they're sort of taciturn little fellows. They don't say much; they just chomp away.


CC
Concur on that.


CMP
Which is about what we're doing up here.


CC
We concur on that, too.


CMP
Breakfast was magnificent as usual. I had sliced peaches, sausage patties, two cups of coffee, and I forget all what else.







CC
That does sound pretty good. As a matter of fact, I'm way overdue for a meal myself, here. I could use some of that.


CMP
Why don't you get Milt to give you 5 minutes off and grab a hamburger?


CC
I suggested that awhile ago. He was pointing out about the weight problem here. We've got to keep the calories low, so I'd better stand by without it.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We've been doing a little flight planning for Apollo 12 up here.


CC
Roger. Go ahead.


CMP
We're trying to calculate how much spagetti and meatballs we can get on board for Al Bean.


CC
I'm not sure the spacecraft will take that much extra weight. Have you made any estimates?


CMP
It'll be close.


CC
11, Houston. The medics at the next console report that the shrew is one animal which can eat six times its own body weight every 24 hours. This may be a satisfactory base line for your spaghetti calculations on Al Bean. Over.


CMP
Okay. Thank you. That's in work.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. It was slightly colder in here last night than it has been on any previous night. Does EECOMM notice any change in his data or any explanation for that?


CC
Roger. Stand by just a moment. We've got to check some temperatures.


CMP
Up until last night it was - if anything, a little on the warm side at night. Last night it was on the chilly side.


CC
Roger there. We'll run down the temperatures for the 2 nights.







CMP
Oh, it's no big thing. Just as a matter of interest.


CC
Roger.


CMP
And how'd you like the command module RCS temperatures?


CC
11, Houston. They all look very good. The lowest temperature was 40 degrees, and we're taking a look at your cabin temperatures now.


CMP
We agree on the CM RCS. No heaters are going 2 to be required by a country mile.


CC
We think that's correct.


CMP
We don't like those heaters, anyway, working off the direct coils.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Peculiar thing, Owen, on the platform alignment is that when I really take my time and do a very slow, careful, precise job of marking. I'm getting about the same star angle difference as when I'm doing it in DTC and have to do a hurried rush job with relatively poor tracking. Star angle differences seem insensitive. It almost made me believe there's a very small bias there somewhere in the sextant.


CC
Roger, 11. Perhaps the 3 degrees per second just isn't that much of a bother. Over.


LMP
Well, he's really trying to explain why he can't get all zeros.


CMP
I think Buzz is probably right. As a matter of fact, one time I made a mark which I thought was a little bit in error, but I tho thought, "Well heck. I'll go ahead and see how it works out anyway," and I got five zeros that time. And when I have thought everything was exactly precisely on, I have consistently been getting 0.01.







CC
Roger. Apparently it pays to hurry.


CMP
I usually do.


CMP
The visibility through the telescope has been very poor. It's, I would say, even worse than the simulator is right now. It requires long periods of dark adaptation which most times are most inconvenient; so it's really a tremendous asset to keep the platform powered up at all times and to keep it tweaked within the capability of the sextant field of view.


CC
Understand, Mike.


CC
11, Houston. Checking your temperatures, it does look like the spacecraft may have cooled down perhaps 2 or 3 degrees in the last 24 hours, and that sounds to be consistent with your report on the comfort level there. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CDR
Is that a LM off phenomenon?


CC
11, Houston. It looks like we'll have to think a little more about that, as to whether it's a LM off or some effect of being out of Lunar orbit. We don't know, so we'll have to puzzle before we can give a better answer.


CDR
Okay.


CMP
Well, if the systems guys have anything they want chased down, we'll be happy to give you any readings or reports or what have you.


CC
Roger. We'll think about that and see if there aren't some other tests to be usefully performed here.


CMP
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. I'll be turning things over to the Green CAP COMM at this time, and see you on the ground tomorrow.







CDR
Okay, Owen. I want to thank you and the whole Purple/Maroon group there for a good job helping Apollo 11.


CC
Thank you, sir.


LMP
Thanks from us to all of you. It was really appreciated.


CMP
Great job, you guys.


CC
Roger, out.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.


CMP
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.


CC
11, this is Houston. With reference to your subjective evaluation that it felt cooler in side the spacecraft last night, we reported earlier that we did indeed see a drop of about 3 degrees over the previous night. Looking back, it appears the crew of Apollo 10 reported similar feelings during the translunar and transearth coast phases. We're wondering if you could give us any indication of the relative amounts of free or condensed water in the cabin last night and the night before from which we could infer humidity. Over.


CDR
Roger. That might be a little bit difficult to do. We'll take a look at the tunnel now. It does seem as though, between the dirt, we had a little bit more moisture in the tunnel. Of course, the LM hadn't been vented when we did translunar.


CC
Roger. We were more curious about the relative amount of moisture between, say, last night and the night before, both of which would have the LM missing.


CMP
There's more moisture in the tunnel now than there has been at any previous time. Subjectively we have been unable to determine any change in - any buildup in humidity. There appears to be no moisture any other place in the spacecraft. For example, the windows are not fogging or - and various other cool spots around the spacecraft - all of them appear to be completely dry.







CC
This is Houston. Roger. Thank you.


CMP
How are all the "Greens" today, Bruce?


CC
Oh, the Greens are in good shape. The actual Green Team has been here for several hours. We're dogging the watch down here to position Ron for entry. Over.


CMP
Roger. Understand. Did Dave Reed get to explain the lunar ... at the press conference?


CC
No, but your comments about Bill Shaffer and the explanations were quoted in the paper last night.


CMP
Oh, oh.


CC
Do you want to say anything more while you're on the line?


CMP
He's right. He's absolutely right.


CMP
How's old White, Bruce? Did he ever let you go get a cup of coffee when we were over on the back side?


CC
Oh, things have been going pretty smoothly down here. He's really not that hard to get along with.


CMP
Oh, he must be mellowing.


CC
We've only got two of them back here right now.


CMP
He always used to make me sit at the console through the back side passes, just for training.


CC
Well, the word we have here is - that was because whenever you came back, you had to be retrained.


CMP
Touché.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Out of curiosity, on those 70 mm cameras, we figure we exposed around 300 in the LM and around a thousand in the command module; and both cameras - or all the 70 mm cameras worked just fine.


CC
Okay. Very good. Thank you.

Go ahead, Houston.


CC
11, this is Houston. Do you all have "Change Lima" for your entry operations checklist dated July 23? Over.


CDR
Dated when?


CC
July 23.


CDR
I'm not sure that we hung around long enough to pick that one up.


CC
Okay. If you've got the entry operations checklist handy, then I'll pass it up to you. Over.


CDR
How can you make changes after lift off?


CMP
You sure you don't mean June?


CC
Negative. It just came up today. Over.


CMP
So, you're the first to get to us. Go ahead.


CC
Okay. On page 6 1 of the entry out checklist down toward the bottom after "MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton," we have three additional steps we'd like you to accomplish. The intent of this is to reduce the oxygen pressure in your manifold and to eliminate the oxygen bleed flow through the potable and waste water tanks during descent. Over.


CMP
Okay. We've got 6 1 out. Go ahead.


CC
Okay. Down at the bottom, you've got "10,000 feet MAIN PARACHUTE DEPLOY, MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton, PUSH within 1 second." And after that step, we'd like you insert "SURGE TANK O2 valve, OFF; REPRESS PACKAGE valve, OFF; and DIRECT O2 valve, OPEN." Do you copy?


CMP
Okay. Down at the bottom, after "MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton, PUSH; SURGE TANK O2, OFF; and REPRESS PACKAGE VALVE, OFF, DIRECT O2, ON" Over.







CC
Roger. And then down at the very botton of page 6 2 where you see "DIRECT O2, OFF VERIFY," delete that step completely. Over.


CMP
Roger.


CC
And for record purposes, this will be "Change Lima." Over.


CMP
Okay. We've got it. How far open do you want this the DIRECT O2 valve to be opened at this point? I guess you want it - just leave it open from that point on?


CC
Roger. It should go all the way open, and you can just leave it on from that point on. The intent is to completely depressurize the oxygen manifold. Over.


CMP
Roger. Copy.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. For your information the All Star game has just ended with the National League winning 9 to 3 over American. Over.

Yes. I heard about that. That was right before the flight.


CC
Right. That big storm.

You have good S band signal strength now, Houston?

CDR
Okay.


CC
Okay. You're coming through loud and clear now, 11, with your patch.


CDR
Good evening. This is the Commander of Apollo 11. A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the Moon. His spaceship, Columbia, took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip to the Moon. It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of the crew as the modern day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet Earth and the same Pacific Ocean tomorrow. First, Mike Collins.


CC
11, this is Houston. We have an LOS here.


CDR
We'll be right back with you.


CC
Roger.


CC
In the interim, you may be interested in knowing that Jan and the children and Pat and the youngsters and Andy Aldrin are down here in the viewing room watching this evening.


CDR
We're glad to hear that.


CC
Okay, 11. You're back on, with Mike in the middle of the screen there.


CMP
Roger. This trip of ours to the Moon may have looked, to you, simple or easy. I'd like to assure you that has not been the case. The Saturn V rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly. This computer up above my head has a 38,000 word vocabulary, each word of which has been very carefullly chosen to be of the utmost value to us, the crew. This switch which I have in my hand now, has over 300 counterparts in the command module alone, this one single switch design. In addition to that, there are myriads of circuit breakers, levers, rods, and other associated controls. The SPS engine, our large rocket engine on the aft end of our service module, must have performed flawlessly, or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit. The parachutes up above my head must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plummet into the







ocean. We have always had confidence that all this equipment will work, and work properly, and we continue to have confidence that it will do so for the remainder of the flight. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people. First, the American workmen who put these pieces of machinery together in the factory. Second, the painstaking work done by the various test teams during the assembly and retest after assembly. And finally, the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center, both in management, in mission planning, in flight control, and last, but not least, in crew training. This operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine. All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all those, I would like to say, thank you very much.


CC
11, this is Houston. We're getting a good picture of Buzz now, but no voice modulation. And would you open up the f stop on the TV camera; try 22, please?


CC
That appears to be a lot better now. We're still not receiving Buzz's audio.


LMP
Good evening. I'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, Apollo 11. As we've been discussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. Neil's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the Moon, "This is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind," I believe sums up these feelings very nicely. We accepted the challenge of going to the Moon; the acceptance of this challenge was inevitable. The relative ease with which we carried out our mission, I believe, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acceptance. Today, I feel we're fully capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of space. In retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously







chose for our spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle. We've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight, depicting the U.S. eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the Earth, from the planet Earth to the Moon; that symbol being the olive branch. It was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the Moon. Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind to me. "When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him."


CDR
The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have through their will, indicated their desire; next, to four administrations, and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, to the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the space suit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft, who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their - their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. To those people, tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.


CC
11, this is Houston. We're getting a zoom view out the window now.


CDR
Apollo 11, signing off.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Do you want to crank up PTC again; do you have some reason to hold its attitude, or what's your pleasure?


CC
You can crank up PTC again, Mike, any time you like. And I might add I thought that was a mighty fine TV presentation. There's certainly nothing I can add to it from down here.


CMP
Thank you.


CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.







CDR
Go ahead.


CC
Okay, 11. I've got a few small items here: one flight plan update and some entry photography information, if you are ready to copy. Over.


CDR
Go ahead.


CC
Roger. At 180 hours 50 minutes GET, we should like to delete your oxygen fuel cell purge.


CDR
Okay.


CC
And on the entry photography, if you are going to use a fresh magazine of color interior film, we recommend the following exposure settings: f11 at 1/250, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.0, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the chutes open. If you are using a magazine, part of which has already been used for interior shots, we recommend f16 at 1/500 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.8, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the parachutes open. And we would like to know the magazine number that you are intending to use if you have a chance. Over.


CMP
Okay. I think we got those. We will be using a fresh one and it will be color interior. Over.


CC
Roger. When you get - get it out, we would like to have the number of the magazine and the letter of the magazine relayed down.


CDR
Okay. And we're thinking that we might want to run some of that at 12 frames per second. And I think we can get everything from 0.5 - 0.5g down; that will only give us about 7.8 minutes and ... frames ... double that. I guess maybe just an occasional burst to 12 frames would be what we want and the rest of it at six. Over.


CC
This is Houston. That plan sounds fine with us, Neil.


CDR
Okay.


CC
And lastly, we would like to know if your stowage configuration for entry is going to conform to







the nominal. The RETRO's down here are anxious to get an accurate c.g. computed for you, and in particular, where the LEVVA's are being stowed. Over.


CDR
Okay. We think we are going to put the LEVVA's and helmets in the hatch bag, and we'll let you know any other nonstandard stowage locations that we complete this evening.


CC
This is Houston. Roger. Out.


CDR
Houston, Apollo 11.


CC
Go ahead, 11.


CDR
Roger. The magazine we'll be using for entry tomorrow is magazine M. Over.

Roger. I'll do that right now.


CC
Roger. And if Mike has a minute, we'd like to do a little bit of troubleshooting. It seems he's either flat chested or something because we've lost respiration rate on the BIOMED telemetry. That is, the ZPN trace down here is flat.

He was shaving a little bit ago. He might have just let it slip. Hold on a moment.


CMP
All the blasted wires are all connected, is all I know.

and southwest corner of Canada. If we can see up that high into the northern hemisphere. Other than that, we'll be on the flight plan.


CC
Roger. For your information, the laser from McDonald Observatory in West Texas will be up from about 181 hours and 30 minutes, on for 1 hour. You should be able to spot the earth out of the number 1 window every time you pass roll 357 degrees and then, of course, you're in West Texas. Over.


CDR
Okay. Thank you.


CMP
How about the number 5 window?


CC
Stand by a minute.


CC
Roger. For the number 5 window. That'll be - every time you pass 230 degrees in roll. Over.

You have a new, new star chart. You must have a new, new star chart. Huh?


CC
Oh, we got a fresh, fresh FAO here.


CDR
Houston, Apollo 11. How much longer do you want us to keep charging battery B?


CC
11, this is Houston. Nominally we're looking for about another hour and a half, but what we'd like to do is continue charging until shortly before you turn in for the night. Over.


CDR
That'll be fine. Are you going to want to charge A again at all?


CC
Negative, 11.


CDR
Okay.


CC
11, this is Houston. At about 180 45, we'll be handing over from Goldstone to Honeysuckle, and I'm handing over to Charlie. See you when you get back. Over.

Apollo 11, Houston. Go ahead.


CMP
Roger, Houston. For RETRO, I have the anticipated location of all the entry stowage, and I suggest you pull out the entry checklist, and we'll go through those maps in the front of it.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you stand by just a few minutes? Charlie and Flight are out getting a weather briefing. They'll be back shortly.


CMP
Is this Ken?

Say again?


CMP
Is this Owen?

No, this is Chuck Lewis. Charlie Duke is out with Flight getting a weather briefing right now.


CMP
Okay. They're out drinking coffee. I know.


CC
(Laughter) They'll be back momentarily.


CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.


CMP
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. Did you get the word on the entry checklist?


CC
Roger, Mike. We sure did. We're ready to talk about it, if you are. Over.


CMP
I think the quickest thing is to go through page by page, the first part of the entry checklist where it has a map. Starting on the page with compartment L2 and L3. Are you with me?


CC
Roger. With you.


CMP
Okay. L2 is as shown. L3 is as shown; there is about half the food remaining in L3.


CC
Roger.







CMP
Where it says - where it says "And note," the CMP PGA is located in the L shaped bag with the other two PGA's. The LM shield was jettisoned with the - Correction, the CMP's helmet shield was jettisoned with the LM, and his helmet and gloves, instead of being in the sleep restraint, are in the hatch bags.


CC
Okay. Let's see now. Your PGA is in the L shaped bag with the other two PGA's, and your helmet and gloves are in the L shaped bag instead of the sleep restraint.


CMP
The helmet and gloves are in the hatch bag, the great big bag that's underneath the left hand couch that you put the hatch in.


CC
Roger. I thought I - That's what I copied. Okay. Go ahead.


CMP
Okay. The next page is identical except a nitpicking point: out R1 we got the entry checklist. Other than that it is identical, and the third page has got some changes.


CC
Go ahead.


CMP
In A1 - Are you with me? I'm over there in compartment A1, now.


CC
Go ahead, Mike. Over.


CMP
In compartment A1, the 16 millimeter magazine will be located in window number 4 instead of 5. Tissue dispensers; there is only one of them left. And compartment U3, the 16 millimeter bracket is on window 4, and the PGA bag - add the CMP's PGA, plus add two LCG's. And compartment A8 delete two LCG's, add one PPK, making a total of four, and add 10 pounds of LM miscellaneous equipment. We told you five the other day. We think ten is probably closer. Over.


CC
Copy.


CMP
And that's all the changes on that page. Ready for the next page?


CC
Roger. Go ahead, Mike.







CMP
On your next page, in compartment B1, we estimate about 15 percent of that food is remaining. In B2 we took PPK out of there and put trash in it. In B3, the 16 millimeter cable, the 18 millimeter lens, and the right angle mirror are on window number 4. And that there brings you all up to date.


CC
Roger. How about the LEVVA's, Mike? Where did you put those? Over.


CMP
They're in the hatch bag.


CC
Roger. Stand by. Our only concern, 11, is with the stuff you got in the hatch bag. That's pretty big bulk between you and A8, and we'd like to talk about moving that over to the sleep restraint. If you will stand by. I'll verify that. Over.


CMP
Okay.


CC
11, Houston. Our recommendation on the gear you got in the helmet bag - correction, hatch bag, would be to remove that stuff and put it in the sleep restraint under the right couch. The reason is that the hatch bag straps are only configured for zero g, and it is a pretty difficult job getting it lashed down. With the gear in the sleep restraint, it's a pretty standard lash down procedure, and you could also use the Beta cord that you have on hoard. You concur? Over.


CMP
Yes. We'll look at it, Charlie, and let you know.


CC
Roger. And I got a couple of other things, Mike. We need to terminate battery B charge at this time, and also, the weather is clobbering in at our targeted landing point due to scattered thunderstorms. We don't want to tangle with one of those, so we are going to move the - your aim point uprange. Correction, it will be downrange, to target for 1500 nautical mile entry so we can guarantee uplift control. The new coordinates are 13 degrees, 19 minutes north, 169 10 minutes west. The weather in that area is super. We got 2000 scattered, 8000 scattered with 10 miles visibility and 6 foot seas and the Hornet is sitting in great position to get to that targeted positton. Over.







CMP
Roger.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Some of the general last minute updates here. On the entry, we had told you on the camera to set it at 50 feet. It turns out the biggest number on the camera is 25 feet, so just set it at infinity. Over.


CMP
Roger. Infinity.

Hello, Houston. Apollo 11.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Go.


CDR
Roger. Good morning. What's the status on midcourse 7?


CC
Roger. We were going to let you sleep in until about 190 hours. Midcourse 7 is not required.


CDR
Okay. Thank you.


CC
Apollo 11. Good morning from Houston. Over.


CDR
Good morning, 11.


CC
Roger. We saw you up stirring around, and we thought that you were probably eating your breakfast there. Just in general, we'll probably start coming up with the uplink of the state vectors and the target loads and what have you at about 190 50, somewhere in that area, and get you started to work.


CDR
Okay.


CC
And in the meantime, while you're eating your breakfast there, I've got the Maroon Bugle all standing by here to give you the morning news.


CDR
Glad to hear it.


CC
Okay. Apollo 11 remains the prime story with the world awaiting your landing today at about 11 49 a.m. Houston time. In Washington, House tax reformers have fashioned a provision which would make it impossible for wealthy individuals to avoid income tax entirely through tax free investments or special allowances. Under the proposal tentatively adopted by the House Ways and Means Committee, everyone would pay taxes on at least half of their income.


CDR
Hang on a minute.


CC
Roger. Standing by.


CDR
Okay. Okay, Ron. We're ready to go again. Thank you.







CC
Roger. Continuing with the Maroon Bugle. President Nixon surprised your wives with a phone call from San Francisco just before he boarded a plane to fly out to meet you. All of them were very touched by your television broadcast. Jan and Pat watched from Mission Control here. The launch of Intelsat from the Cape was postponed for the fourth time last night. The problem was said to be a malfunctioning nitrogen regulator in the second stage of Delta. A new attempt will be made to launch it tonight. The research submarine Ben Franklin, which is studying the Gulf Stream, set a record by drifting 24 hours from 10 to 100 feet above the ocean floor in 1300 feet of water off the Georgia coast. The mission is led by Jacques Picard. Wally Schirra has been elected to a 5 year term on the board of trustees of the Detroit Institute of Technology. He will serve on the Institute's development committee. Air Canada says it has accepted 2300 reservations for flights to the Moon in the past 5 days. It might be noted that more than 100 have been made by men for their mothers in law. And finally, it appears that rather than killing romantic songs about the Moon, you have inspired hundreds of song writers. Nashville, Tennessee, which probably houses the largest collection of recording companies and song publishers in the country, now reports it is being flooded by Moon songs. Some will make it. The song at the top of the best sellers list this week is, "In the year 2525." Morning Bugle. Out.

Roger, 11. We don't have to worry about it any more. The altimeter out there is now standard, 29.92; but basically what it means is that if I give you a plus 10 feet, for instance, that means that you will hit the water with the ailtimeter reading 10 feet. Over.

LMP
Okay. Go ahead.

Okay. On page E6 1, your RRT is 07 20, your 50K is 08 16; 40K is 08 30; your 24K is 09 02; and your 10K is 09 51. 0wer.


LMP
Okay. RRT, 07 20, 50 000, 08 16. That's - 07 20 is - is the time of steam pressure peg from RRT; and 40 000, 08 30; 24 000, 09 02; 10 000, 09 51.


CC
11, Houston. You started out right, and then the numbers you read back were correct; but I didn't get your comment in between there.


LMP
I assume that - all I wanted to know is that first time, 07 20, that's the time of steam pressure peg. Right?


CC
That's affirmative.


LMP
Okay.


CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Ron, I'm ready to copy your message about the constant drag level.







CC
Okay, Mike. Of course, this is in the event the G&amp;N and the EMS quits and you have to fly the constant g; and what we're trying to do is extend the constant g range from 1100 to 1500 miles. We've run this procedure in the simulator, and it works fine. Basically, I'll go through it - just go through it, and then if you have any questions come back. But it's the same lift vector up until MAX g, and then lift vector down, and then modulate the lift vector until g dot goes to zero. Okay. This procedure is essentially the same so far. And then hold g dot zero until you pass the RETRO elapsed time of V circular; and then after you pass this RETRO elapsed time of V circular, roll to a gimbal angle of 45 degrees, and then hold this constant bank angle of 45 degrees until you come to the RETRO elapsed time of drogues. Over.


CMP
Okay. It sounds straightforward enough. Understand constant g backup backup procedure, lift vector up until MAX g and then lift vector down; then modulate until bank angle until g dot equals zero. Maintain g dot equals zero until subcircular, then roll 45 degrees and hold until drogue time. Over.


CC
Okay. That's mighty fine, Mike. That's correct.

And the Sun is going down on schedule. It's getting real dark in here.

Apollo 11. Houston. Copy.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We see you getting ready for SEP. Everything looks mighty fine down here.


CMP
Same here, Ron. Thank you.


CC
Apollo 11, Houston. You're still looking mighty fine from here. You're cleared for landing.


CDR
We appreciate that, Ron. Thank you.


CMP
Roger. Gears down and locked.


CC
Roger.


CMP
Thank you.


LMP
Houston, we got the service module going by. A little high and a little bit to the right.


CC
Roger. Thank you.


CMP
And it's rotating just like it should be. Thrusters are firing.


CC
Good. It's got a lot of gas there to burn out, too.







LMP
It's coming across now from right to left.


CC
Houston. Roger.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. You going to turn on the tape recorder shortly?


CC
11, Houston. You can go ahead and turn it on.


LMP
Okay. I'll have to go to command reset to do that.


08 02 57 34 CC
11, Houston. That's negative. All you have to do is turn it on. That'll be fine.


LMP
I guess I don't know how to turn it on, then. I got PCM, ANTILOG RECORD, FORWARD; high bit rate, and barber pole.


CC
11, Houston. We'll send the ON command from down here, see if it works.


LMP
Okay.


LMP
Got our friend the Moon whipping by the field of view right now.


CC
Roger. Copy.


CC
11, Houston. We'll have you for about 3 or 4 minutes through Redstone and then pick you up after blackout through ARIA.


LMP
Roger.


LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. I'm going to go to COMMAND RESET and turn the tape on.


CC
...


CC
11, Houston. Recommend negative on that. That will put us in low bit rate.


LMP
0kay. I already put it to COMMAND RESET, but I still have barber pole on the tape. And now my switch is high bit rate.


CC
Okay. That will be fine. On 225, there, if you can reach it, Buzz, the last two circuit breakers in the second row from the bottom, punch those in.







CC
And 11, Houston, don't mess around with that 225 there.


LMP
Okay.


CC
And 11, Houston. You're going over the hill there shortly. You're looking mighty fine to us.


CDR
See you later.
